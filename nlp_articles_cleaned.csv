1,How Google’s DeepMind tool is ‘more quickly’ forecasting hurricane behavior,Eric Holthaus,2025-11-16T13:00:32.000Z,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/nov/16/google-deepmind-hurricane-forecast,"‘Less expensive and time consuming’ model helps with fast and accurate predictions, possibly saving lives and property When then Tropical Storm Melissa was churning south of Haiti, Philippe Papin, a National Hurricane Center (NHC) meteorologist, had confidence it was about to grow into a monster hurricane. As the lead forecaster on duty, he predicted that in just 24 hours the storm would become a category 4 hurricane and begin a turn towards the coast of Jamaica. No NHC forecaster had ever issued such a bold forecast for rapid strengthening. But Papin had an ace up his sleeve: artificial intelligence in the form of Google’s new DeepMind hurricane model – released for the first time in June. And, as predicted, Melissa did become a storm of astonishing strength that tore through Jamaica. Forecasters at the NHC are increasingly leaning hard on Google DeepMind. On the morning of 25 October, Papin explained in his public discussion and on social media that Google’s model was a primary reason he was so confident : “Roughly 40/50 Google DeepMind ensemble members show Melissa becoming a Category 5. While I am not ready to forecast that intensity yet given the track uncertainty, that remains a possibility. “It appears likely that a period of rapid intensification will occur as the storm moves slowly over very warm ocean waters which is the highest oceanic heat content in the entire Atlantic basin.” Google DeepMind is the first AI model dedicated to hurricanes , and now the first to beat traditional weather forecasters at their own game. Through all 13 Atlantic storms so far this year , Google’s model is the best – even beating human forecasters on track predictions. Melissa eventually made landfall in Jamaica at category 5 strength, one of the strongest landfalls ever documented in nearly two centuries of record-keeping across the Atlantic basin. Papin’s bold forecast likely gave people in Jamaica extra time to prepare for the disaster, possibly saving lives and property. Google DeepMind has been making weather forecasts for a few years now , and the parent forecast system from which the new hurricane model is derived also performed spectacularly well in diagnosing large-scale weather patterns last year. Google’s model works by spotting patterns that traditional time-intensive physics-based weather models may miss. “They do it much more quickly than their physics-based cousins, and the computing power is less expensive and time consuming,” Michael Lowry, a former NHC forecaster, said. “What this hurricane season has proven in short order is that the newcomer AI weather models are competitive with and, in some cases, more accurate than the slower physics-based weather models we’ve traditionally leaned on,” Lowry said. To be sure, Google DeepMind is an example of machine learning – a technique that has been used in data-heavy sciences like meteorology for years – and is not generative AI like ChatGPT. Machine learning takes mounds of data and pulls out patterns from them in a such a way that its model only takes a few minutes to come up with an answer, and can do so on a desktop computer – in strong contrast to the flagship models that governments have used for decades that can take hours to run and require some of the biggest supercomputers in the world . Still, the fact that Google’s model could outperform previous gold-standard legacy models so quickly is nothing short of amazing to meteorologists who have spent their careers trying to forecast the world’s strongest storms. Sign up to First Thing Our US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion “I’m impressed,” said James Franklin, a retired NHC forecaster. “The sample is now large enough that it’s pretty clear this is not a case of beginner’s luck.” Franklin said that although Google DeepMind is beating all other models on forecasting the future path of hurricanes worldwide this year, like many AI models it occasionally gets high-end intensity forecasts wrong . It struggled with Hurricane Erin earlier this year, as it was also undergoing rapid intensification to category 5 north of the Caribbean. It also struggled with Typhoon Kalmaegi – which made landfall in the Philippines on Monday. In the coming offseason, Franklin said he plans to talk with Google about how it can make the DeepMind output even more helpful for forecasters by providing additional under-the-hood data they can use to assess exactly why it is coming up with the its answers. “The one thing that nags at me is that while these forecasts seem to be really, really good, the output of the model is kind of a black box,” said Franklin. There has never been a private, for-profit company that has produced a top-level weather model which allows researchers a peek into its methods – unlike nearly all other models which are provided free to the public in their entirety by the governments that designed and maintain them. While Google has made top-level output of DeepMind publicly available in real time on a dedicated website , its methods have still largely been hidden. Google is not alone in starting to use AI to solve difficult weather forecasting problems. The US and European governments also have their own AI weather models in the works – which have also shown improved skill over previous non-AI versions . The next steps in AI weather forecasts seem to be startup companies taking swings at previously tough-to-solve problems such as sub-seasonal outlooks and better advance warnings of tornado outbreaks and flash flooding – and they are receiving US government funding to do so . One company, WindBorne Systems, is even launching its own weather balloons to fill the gaps in the US weather-observing network, which has recently been downsized by the Trump administration .

2,AI slop tops Billboard and Spotify charts as synthetic music spreads,Aisha Down,2025-11-13T21:58:04.000Z,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/nov/13/ai-music-spotify-billboard-charts,"Hits include country songs and a Dutch anti-refugee anthem, both entirely made without human composition Three songs generated by artificial intelligence topped music charts this week, reaching the highest spots on Spotify and Billboard charts. Walk My Walk and Livin’ on Borrowed Time by the outfit Breaking Rust topped Spotify’s “Viral 50” songs in the US, which documents the “most viral tracks right now” on a daily basis, according to the streaming service. A Dutch song, We Say No, No, No to an Asylum Center, an anti-migrant anthem by JW “Broken Veteran” that protests against the creation of new asylum centers, took the top position in Spotify’s global version of the viral chart around the same time. Breaking Rust also appeared in the top five on the global chart. “You can kick rocks if you don’t like how I talk,” reads a lyric from Walk My Walk, a seeming double entendre challenging those opposed to AI-generated music. Days after its ascent up the charts, the Dutch song disappeared from Spotify and YouTube, as did Broken Veteran’s other music. Spotify told the Dutch outlet NU.nl that the company had not removed the music, the owners of the song rights had. Broken Veteran told the outlet that he did not know why his music had disappeared and that he was investigating, hoping to return it soon. In an email to the Guardian, Broken Veteran, who declined to give his real name, said that he saw AI as “just another tool for expression, particularly valuable for people like me who have something to say but lack traditional musical training”, adding that the technology had “democratized music creation”. He claimed his songs “express frustration with governmental policies, not with migrants as individuals”. For three weeks, Walk My Walk has led Billboard’s “Country Digital Song Sales” chart, which measures downloads and digital purchases. The list is minor in comparison to Billboard’s “Hot Country Songs” or “Top Country Albums”, which measure a broader range of signals of success. Breaking Rust did not respond to a request for comment. AI-made music spreads These three songs are part of a flood of AI-generated music that has come to saturate streaming platforms. A study published on Wednesday by the streaming app Deezer estimates that 50,000 AI-generated songs are uploaded to the platform every day – 34% of all the music submitted. Walk My Walk and We Say No, No, No to an Asylum Center, aren’t the first AI-generated songs to reach a mass audience. Over the summer, AI-generated songs from a group going by the name Velvet Sundown amassed over a million streams on Spotify, in what one member later described as an “art hoax”. Ed Newton-Rex, a musician and the founder of a non-profit that certifies generative AI companies’ data training practices as fair to artists, says that the sheer number of AI-generated songs now online is a key factor driving the ascent of a few AI-generated hits. “It’s part of the very rapid trend of AI music gaining in popularity essentially because it’s spreading in volume,” he said. “What you have here is 50,000 tracks a day that are competing with human musicians. You have a new, hyperscalable competitor and, moreover, this competitor that was built by exploitation.” AI music has improved in quality from its early, clanking days. As part of its study, Deezer surveyed 9,000 people in eight countries and found that 97% could not distinguish between AI-generated music and human-written music. “There’s no denying it. I think it’s fair to say you can’t distinguish the best AI music from human-composed music now,” Newton-Rex said. Sign up to TechScape A weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our lives after newsletter promotion New distribution models for AI-made music Human-level quality is not the only reason for the success of AI-generated tracks on Spotify. As with many parts of the AI slop economy, there are a set of tools and platforms out there that enable AI music to spread easily – and sub-communities of users eager to share tips to game the system. Jack Righteous, a blog on AI content creation, recommends that its followers generate “streams of passive income” using a music distribution service called DistroKid, which funnels royalties to music creators every time their AI tracks are streamed on YouTube, Spotify or TikTok. DistroKid is part of an ecosystem of online music distribution services, such as Amuse , Landr and CDBaby , which help creators place their music on major platforms like YouTube and Spotify. These services have varied policies on AI-generated content, and blogs describe DistroKid’s as “more lenient”. Several hits from Breaking Rust, including Livin’ on Borrowed Time and Resilient , appear to be distributed by DistroKid. “Basically every piece of AI music you see isn’t distributed by a regular label. They’re made by a person in their bedroom and uploaded to these distribution sites,” said Chris Dalla Riva, author of the book Uncharted Territory , on the data behind music virality. When reached for comment, Spotify pointed to its policy on AI-generated tracks . Artificial intelligence (AI) news",1000,399
3,AI firm claims it stopped Chinese state-sponsored cyber-attack campaign,Aisha Down,2025-11-14T16:27:57.000Z,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/nov/14/ai-anthropic-chinese-state-sponsored-cyber-attack,"Anthropic says financial firms and government agencies were attacked ‘largely without human intervention’ A leading artificial intelligence company claims to have stopped a China-backed “cyber espionage” campaign that was able to infiltrate financial firms and government agencies with almost no human oversight. The US-based Anthropic said its coding tool, Claude Code, was “manipulated” by a Chinese state-sponsored group to attack 30 entities around the world in September, achieving a “handful of successful intrusions”. This was a “significant escalation” from previous AI-enabled attacks it monitored, it wrote in a blogpost on Thursday , because Claude acted largely independently: 80 to 90% of the operations involved in the attack were performed without a human in the loop. “The actor achieved what we believe is the first documented case of a cyber-attack largely executed without human intervention at scale,” it wrote. Anthropic did not clarify which financial institutions and government agencies had been targeted, or what exactly the hackers had achieved – although it did say they were able to access their targets’ internal data. It said Claude had made numerous mistakes in executing the attacks, at times making up facts about its targets, or claiming to have “discovered” information that was free to access. Policymakers and some experts said the findings were an unsettling sign of how capable certain AI systems have grown: tools such as Claude are now able to work independently over longer periods of time. “Wake the f up. This is going to destroy us – sooner than we think – if we don’t make AI regulation a national priority tomorrow,” the US senator Chris Murphy wrote on X in response to the findings. “AI systems can now perform tasks that previously required skilled human operators,” said Fred Heiding, a computing security researcher at Harvard University. “It’s getting so easy for attackers to cause real damage. The AI companies don’t take enough responsibility.” Other cybersecurity experts were more sceptical, pointing to inflated claims about AI-fuelled cyber-attacks in recent years – such as an AI-powered “password cracker” from 2023 that performed no better than conventional methods – and suggesting Anthropic was trying to create hype around AI. “To me, Anthropic is describing fancy automation, nothing else,” said Michał Woźniak, an independent cybersecurity expert. “Code generation is involved, but that’s not ‘intelligence’, that’s just spicy copy-paste.” Woźniak said Anthropic’s release was a distraction from a bigger cybersecurity concern: businesses and governments integrating “complex, poorly understood” AI tools into their operations without understanding them, exposing them to vulnerabilities. The real threat, he said, were cybercriminals themselves – and lax cybersecurity practices. Sign up to TechScape A weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our lives after newsletter promotion Anthropic, like all leading AI companies, has guardrails that are supposed to stop its models from assisting in cyber-attacks – or promoting harm generally. However, it said, the hackers were able to subvert these guardrails by telling Claude to role-play being an “employee of a legitimate cybersecurity firm” conducting tests. Woźniak said: “Anthropic’s valuation is at around $180bn, and they still can’t figure out how not to have their tools subverted by a tactic a 13-year-old uses when they want to prank-call someone.” Marius Hobbhahn, the founder of Apollo Research, a company that evaluates AI models for safety, said the attacks were a sign of what could come as capabilities grow. “I think society is not well prepared for this kind of rapidly changing landscape in terms of AI and cyber capabilities. I would expect many more similar events to happen in the coming years, plausibly with larger consequences.” The best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.

4,"Risks to children playing Roblox ‘deeply disturbing’, say researchers",Libby Brooks,2025-04-14T11:00:42.000Z,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/apr/14/risks-children-roblox-deeply-disturbing-researchers,"Exclusive: Gaming platform accused of ‘troubling disconnect between child-friendly appearance and reality’ ‘A man approached him’: parents describe their children’s Roblox problems “Deeply disturbing” research exposes how easy it is for children to encounter inappropriate content and interact unsupervised with adults on the gaming platform Roblox. It comes as parents shared their serious concerns about children experiencing addiction, seeing traumatising content and being approached by strangers on the hugely popular website and app. Roblox acknowledges that children using the platform may be exposed to harmful content and “bad actors”. It says it is working hard to fix this, but that industry-wide collaboration and government intervention are needed. Describing itself as “the ultimate virtual universe”, Roblox features millions of games and interactive environments, known collectively as “experiences”. Some of the content is developed by Roblox, but much of it is user-generated. In 2024, the platform had more than 85 million daily active users, an estimated 40% of whom are under 13. While the company said it “deeply sympathised” with parents whose children came to harm on the platform, it said “tens of millions of people have a positive, enriching and safe experience on Roblox every day”. However, in an investigation shared with the Guardian , the digital-behaviour experts Revealing Reality discovered “something deeply disturbing … a troubling disconnect between Roblox’s child-friendly appearance and the reality of what children experience on the platform”. Revealing Reality created multiple Roblox accounts, registering them to fictional users aged five, nine, 10, 13 and 40-plus. The accounts interacted only with one another, and not with users outside the experiment, to ensure their avatars’ behaviours were not influenced in any way. Despite new tools launched last week aimed at giving parents more control over their children’s accounts, the researchers concluded: “Safety controls that exist are limited in their effectiveness and there are still significant risks for children on the platform.” The report found that children as young as five were able to communicate with adults while playing games on the platform, and found examples of adults and children interacting with no effective age verification. This was despite Roblox changing its settings last November so that accounts listed as belonging to under-13s can no longer directly message others outside of games or experiences, instead having access only to public broadcast messages. The report also found the avatar belonging to the 10-year-old’s account could access “highly suggestive environments”. These included a hotel space where they could view a female avatar wearing fishnet stockings gyrating on a bed and other avatars lying on top of each other in sexually suggestive poses, and a public bathroom space where characters were urinating and avatars could choose fetish accessories to dress up in. Researchers found that their test avatars overheard conversations between other players verbalising sexual activity, as well as repeated slurping, kissing and grunting noises, when using the voice chat function. Roblox says that all voice chat – which is available to phone-verified accounts registered as belonging to users aged 13 and above – is subject to real-time AI moderation. They also found that a test avatar registered to an adult was able to ask for the five-year-old test avatar’s Snapchat details using barely coded language. Though Roblox says in-game text chat is subject to built-in filters and moderation, the report says this is an example of how easily such measures can be circumvented, creating opportunities for predatory behaviour. Sign up to Pushing Buttons Keza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gaming after newsletter promotion Roblox said it recognised “there are bad actors on the internet” but added this was “an issue that goes beyond Roblox and needs to be addressed through collaboration with governments and an industry-wide commitment to strong safety measures across all platforms”. It also acknowledged that age verification for under-13s “remains an industry challenge”. Stories shared by parents following a Guardian Community callout include that of a 10-year-old boy who was groomed by an adult he met on the platform, and a nine-year-old girl who started having panic attacks after seeing sexual content while gaming. Damon De Ionno, the research director of Revealing Reality, said: “The new safety features announced by Roblox last week don’t go far enough. Children can still chat with strangers not on their friends list, and with 6 million experiences [on the platform], often with inaccurate descriptions and ratings, how can parents be expected to moderate?” The crossbench peer and internet safety campaigner Beeban Kidron said the research exposed the platform’s “systematic failure to keep children safe”, adding: “This kind of user research should be routine for a product like Roblox.” Matt Kaufman, the chief safety officer at Roblox, said: “Trust and safety are at the core of everything we do. We continually evolve our policies, technologies, and moderation efforts to protect our community, especially young people. This includes investing in advanced safety tools, working closely with experts and empowering parents and caregivers with robust controls and resources. “In 2024 alone, we added more than 40 new safety enhancements, and we remain fully committed to going further to make Roblox a safe and civil place for everyone .” Children's tech Internet safety Games Online multiplayer games Children Parents and parenting news",998,436
5,"Teenage girls’ TikTok skincare regimes offer little to no benefit, research shows",Nicola Davis,2025-06-09T14:17:34.000Z,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jun/09/teenage-girls-tiktok-skincare-regimes-offer-little-to-no-benefit-research-shows,"With number of young girls sharing videos rising, study says following instructions can irritate skin and lead to allergies Skincare regimes demonstrated by young influencers on TikTok offer little to no benefit, researchers have found, saying that on the contrary they raise the risk of skin irritations and lifelong allergies in children. The team behind the study say there has been a rise in young girls sharing videos of complex skincare routines with moisturisers, toners, acne treatments and anti-ageing products. In the first study of its kind, researchers analysed such videos on the platform and found the regimes are not only laborious – some girls wake up as early as 4.30am to fit in their routines – but pricey, unnecessary and potentially harmful. “The risks associated with using these products, especially in young girls, far outweighs whatever marginal benefit you may get from using the active ingredients,” said Dr Molly Hales, the first author of the research from Northwestern University. Hales added that while social mediacould be a place for playfulness and self-expression, young girls did not need such regimes. “The danger is when girls get the message that this is something that they have to do to take care of their skin and to protect their health,” she said. “These products don’t increase the health of your skin and they probably worsen your skin integrity over time.” She said a gentle cleanser once or twice a day and the application of sunscreen was sufficient. Writing in the journal Paediatrics, Hales and colleagues report how they created two TikTok accounts, purportedly for 13-year-olds and, and accumulated a sample of 100 skincare routines videos filmed by young people. The team found all but one of the 82 creators were girls, and their age ranged from seven to 18 years old. “Almost all content creators had clear, light skin without visible blemishes,” the researchers write, adding the videos “made frequent reference to aspirational beauty ideals that may be tied to whiteness”. The study reveals the skincare regimes involved six products on average, often from the same brands, with a total average cost of $168 (£124). However, some involved more than a dozen products with a total cost of more than $500 (£369). “Get Ready With Me” videos were the most common, followed by “Skin Care Routine” and “After School” skincare routine videos. The team found many of the ingredients in the featured products, such as citric acid, carry a risk of skin irritation and sun sensitivity – meaning they increase the chance of sunburn and other skin damage. Yet only 26% of the 84 videos showing daytime skincare routines included a sunscreen – something that authors called “a significant missed opportunity”. Hales said the use of products with multiple active ingredients, or layering products with the same active ingredients, increased the risk of skin irritation. The researchers found that among the 25 top-viewed videos, 76% contained at least one potential contact allergen – often fragrance. Prof Tess McPherson of the British Association of Dermatologists, who was not involved in the work, said the study was important, backing up anecdotal reports of an increase in young people attending clinics with skin irritation. “We’re certainly seeing a huge increase in people wanting something they call perfect or flawless skin, which we know is unachievable [and] unhelpful – it doesn’t make people happy,” she said. McPherson said she was aware of young people asking for birthday money to put towards expensive skincare products, many of which were being targeted at young girls through appealing packaging. As well as the risks highlighted by the study, McPherson said the skincare videos contributed to an increase in stigma around conditions such as acne and eczema as well as a fear of ageing, a message she said was reinforced by women embracing Botox and fillers. “Younger and younger children are seeking skincare products when they don’t need them, they’re not helpful,” she said. “This is a very concerning statement on society and how we view how skin should look.” A TikTok spokesperson said: “This type of content is common across all media, and the authors admit they did not assess its impact on teen wellbeing. However, they did find actual benefits to teen self-expression, parent-teen bonding, and building a supportive community on TikTok.” This article was amended on 9 and 10 June 2025 to give the correct honorific for Prof Tess McPherson. It was accurate in the original version, but was then amended in error to say “Dr Tess McPherson”. TikTok Young people Skincare Social media Beauty Digital media news",879,373
6,Father of teen whose death was linked to social media has ‘lost faith’ in Ofcom,Dan Milmo,2025-11-15T10:00:07.000Z,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/nov/15/molly-russell-family-social-media-ofcom,"Ian Russell says watchdog lacks ‘urgency’ and is not willing to use its powers ‘to the extent required’ The father of Molly Russell, a British teenager who killed herself after viewing harmful online content , has called for a change in leadership at the UK’s communications watchdog after losing faith in its ability to make the internet safer for children. Ian Russell, whose 14 year-old daughter took her own life in 2017, said Ofcom had “repeatedly” demonstrated that it does not grasp the urgency of keeping under-18s safe online and was failing to implement new digital laws forcefully. “I’ve lost confidence in the current leadership at Ofcom,” he told the Guardian. “They have repeatedly demonstrated that they don’t grasp the urgency of this task and they have shown that they don’t seem to be willing to use their powers to the extent that is required.” Russell’s comments came in the same week the technology secretary, Liz Kendall, wrote to Ofcom saying she was “deeply concerned” about delays in rolling out parts of the Online Safety Act (OSA), a landmark piece of legislation laying down safety rules for social media, search and video platforms. Russell, who has become an influential internet safety campaigner since his daughter’s death, said that last year he raised concerns with Ofcom’s chief executive, Melanie Dawes, about an online suicide forum accessible to UK users . Ofcom opened an investigation into the site this year, shortly after assuming new regulatory powers from the OSA, and the forum voluntarily geo-blocked access to UK users. But Russell said the investigation appeared to have “stalled” before the regulator ramped up its probe this month – when it emerged the forum was still available to UK users through a previously undetected “mirror site”. “If Ofcom can’t deal with something as black and white, cut and dried as that, you have to question what else they can deal with,” Russell said. Ofcom addressed Russell’s concerns in a letter, saying that the site’s geo-block had been constantly monitored, but the mirror site – operating under a wholly different domain name – had come to the regulator’s attention only this month. Russell said he shared Kendall’s disappointment in delays to implementing further elements of the OSA, including strict rules for the largest and most influential online platforms. Ofcom has said the delays were due to a court challenge from the Wikimedia foundation – the charity behind Wikipedia. The watchdog said it had the “highest respect” for bereaved families and pointed to achievements under its watch, such as age checks for pornography sites and a crackdown on child sexual abuse material. “We are working with urgency to drive tech firms to deliver a safer life online for children and adults in the UK, and while the job is not done, change is happening,” a spokesperson said. The Molly Rose Foundation, a charity founded by Molly’s family, has submitted a letter to the UK government calling on ministers to extend a legal requirement for transparency from public officials to apply to tech companies as well. The letter urged Alex Davies-Jones, the victims minister, to expand the remit of the public authority (accountability) bill, which introduces a “duty of candour” for public officials. The bill, brought in after criticism of how police officers presented evidence at the Hillsborough inquiry, requires public bodies and officials to help investigations – including coroner’s courts – by providing information and evidence proactively, without favouring their own position. The foundation believes that requiring companies regulated by the OSA to abide by the same rules would prevent them from dragging their heels over submitting evidence in the case of a death where social media use was potentially involved. The inquest into Molly’s death was subject to delays owing to wrangles with Meta over submitting evidence. The letter said: “This shift would fundamentally reset the relationship between tech companies and their victims – a move that would require tech companies to act transparently and expeditiously when responding to legal requests.” Recent legislation has bolstered coroners’ powers, enabling them to demand evidence of social media use from tech companies under the OSA and prevent important data from being deleted, but the letter’s signatories believe tougher powers are needed. Among more than 40 signatories were members of the group Bereaved Families for Online Safety and the Meta whistleblower Arturo Béjar. A government spokesperson pointed to the legal changes enhancing coroners’ powers to require information from tech firms. “The Online Safety Act supports coroners conducting inquests and families seeking the truth in compelling companies to share data fully where there is evidence of a link between a child’s death and their social media use',” said the spokesperson. “As promised in our manifesto, we have also strengthened this by also giving coroners the power to request that data is preserved to support inquests. We will not hesitate to act, and will work with families and campaigners to ensure we protect families and children.” In the UK, the youth suicide charity Papyrus can be contacted on 0800 068 4141 or email pat@papyrus-uk.org , and in the UK and Ireland Samaritans can be contacted on freephone 116 123, or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie .

7,Are we living in a golden age of stupidity?,Sophie McBain,2025-10-18T10:00:42.000Z,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/oct/18/are-we-living-in-a-golden-age-of-stupidity-technology,"From brain-rotting videos to AI creep, every technological advance seems to make it harder to work, remember, think and function independently … S tep into the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Media Lab in Cambridge, US, and the future feels a little closer. Glass cabinets display prototypes of weird and wonderful creations, from tiny desktop robots to a surrealist sculpture created by an AI model prompted to design a tea set made from body parts. In the lobby, an AI waste-sorting assistant named Oscar can tell you where to put your used coffee cup. Five floors up, research scientist Nataliya Kosmyna has been working on wearable brain-computer interfaces she hopes will one day enable people who cannot speak, due to neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, to communicate using their minds. Kosmyna spends a lot of her time reading and analysing people’s brain states. Another project she is working on is a wearable device – one prototype looks like a pair of glasses – that can tell when someone is getting confused or losing focus. Around two years ago, she began receiving out-of-the blue emails from strangers who reported that they had started using large language models such as ChatGPT and felt their brain had changed as a result. Their memories didn’t seem as good – was that even possible, they asked her? Kosmyna herself had been struck by how quickly people had already begun to rely on generative AI. She noticed colleagues using ChatGPT at work, and the applications she received from researchers hoping to join her team started to look different. Their emails were longer and more formal and, sometimes, when she interviewed candidates on Zoom, she noticed they kept pausing before responding and looking off to the side – were they getting AI to help them, she wondered, shocked. And if they were using AI, how much did they even understand of the answers they were giving? With some MIT colleagues, Kosmyna set up an experiment that used an electroencephalogram to monitor people’s brain activity while they wrote essays, either with no digital assistance, or with the help of an internet search engine, or ChatGPT. She found that the more external help participants had, the lower their level of brain connectivity, so those who used ChatGPT to write showed significantly less activity in the brain networks associated with cognitive processing, attention and creativity. In other words, whatever the people using ChatGPT felt was going on inside their brains, the scans showed there wasn’t much happening up there. The study’s participants, who were all enrolled at MIT or nearby universities, were asked, right after they had handed in their work, if they could recall what they had written. “Barely anyone in the ChatGPT group could give a quote,” Kosmyna says. “That was concerning, because you just wrote it and you do not remember anything.” Kosmyna is 35, trendily dressed in a blue shirt dress and a big, multicoloured necklace, and she speaks faster than most people can think. As she observes, writing an essay requires skills that are important in our wider lives: the ability to synthesise information, consider competing perspectives and construct an argument. You use these skills in everyday conversations. “How are you going to deal with that? Are you going to be, like, ‘Err … can I just check my phone?’” she says. The experiment was small (54 participants) and has not yet been peer reviewed. In June, however, Kosmyna posted it online, thinking other researchers might find it interesting, and then she went about her day, unaware that she had just created an international media frenzy. Alongside the journalist requests, she received more than 4,000 emails from around the world, many from stressed-out teachers who feel their students aren’t learning properly because they are using ChatGPT to do their homework. They worry AI is creating a generation who can produce passable work but don’t have any usable knowledge or understanding of the material. The fundamental issue, Kosmyna says, is that as soon as a technology becomes available that makes our lives easier, we’re evolutionarily primed to use it. “Our brains love shortcuts, it’s in our nature. But your brain needs friction to learn. It needs to have a challenge.” If brains need friction but also instinctively avoid it, it’s interesting that the promise of technology has been to create a “frictionless” user experience, to ensure that, provided we slide from app to app or screen to screen, we will meet no resistance. The frictionless user experience is why we unthinkingly offload ever more information and work to our digital devices; it’s why internet rabbit holes are so easy to fall down and so hard to climb out of; it’s why generative AI has already integrated itself so completely into most people’s lives. We know, from our collective experience, that once you become accustomed to the hyperefficient cybersphere, the friction-filled real world feels harder to deal with. So you avoid phone calls, use self-checkouts, order everything from an app; you reach for your phone to do the maths sum you could do in your head, to check a fact before you have to dredge it up from memory, to input your destination on Google maps and travel from A to B on autopilot. Maybe you stop reading books because maintaining that kind of focus feels like friction; maybe you dream of owning a self-driving car. Is this the dawn of what the writer and education expert Daisy Christodoulou calls a “ stupidogenic society ”, a parallel to an obesogenic society , in which it is easy to become stupid because machines can think for you? Human intelligence is too broad and varied to be reduced to words such as “stupid”, but there are worrying signs that all this digital convenience is costing us dearly. Across the economically developed countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), Pisa scores, which measure 15-year-olds’ reading, maths and science, tended to peak around 2012. While over the 20th century IQ scores increased globally, perhaps due to improved access to education and better nutrition, in many developed countries they appear to have been declining. Falling test and IQ scores are the subject of hot debate. What is harder to dispute is that, with every technological advance, we deepen our dependence on digital devices and find it harder to work or remember or think or, frankly, function without them. “It’s only software developers and drug dealers who call people users,” Kosmyna mutters at one point, frustrated at AI companies’ determination to push their products on to the public before we fully understand the psychological and cognitive costs. In the ever-expanding, frictionless online world, you are first and foremost a user: passive, dependent. In the dawning era of AI-generated misinformation and deepfakes, how will we maintain the scepticism and intellectual independence we’ll need? By the time we agree that our minds are no longer our own, that we simply cannot think clearly without tech assistance, how much of us will be left to resist? S tart telling people that you’re worried about what intelligent machines are doing to our brains and there’s a risk that, in the not-too-distant future, everyone will laugh at what a fuddy-duddy you were. Socrates worried that writing would weaken people’s memories and encourage only superficial understanding: not wisdom but “the conceit of wisdom” – an argument that is strikingly similar to many critiques of AI. What happened instead was that writing and the technological advances that followed – the printing press, mass media, the internet era – meant that ever more people had access to ever more information. More people could develop great ideas, and they could share those ideas more easily, and this made us cleverer and more innovative, as individuals and as communities. After all, writing didn’t only change how we access and retain information; it changed how we think. A person can achieve more complex tasks with a notebook and paper to hand than without: most people can’t work out 53,683 divided by 7 in their head but could have a stab at doing long division on paper. I couldn’t have dictated this piece, but writing helped me organise and clarify my thoughts. As humans, we’re very good at what experts call “cognitive offloading”, namely using our physical environment to reduce our mental load, and this in turn helps us achieve more complex cognitive tasks. Imagine how much harder it would be to function each day without a calendar or phone reminders, or without Google to remember everything for you. In the best case scenario, intelligent people working in partnership with intelligent machines will achieve new intellectual feats and solve tricky problems: we’re already seeing, for instance, how AI can help scientists discover new drugs faster and doctors detect cancer earlier and more efficiently . The complication is, if technology is truly making us cleverer – turning us into efficient, information-processing machines – why do we spend so much time feeling dumb? Last year, “brain rot” was named Oxford University Press’s word of the year, a term that captures both the specific feeling of mindlessness that descends when we spend too much time scrolling through rubbish online and the corrosive, aggressively dumb content itself, the nonsense memes and AI garble. When we hold our phones we have, in theory, most of the world’s accumulated knowledge at our fingertips, so why do we spend so much time dragging our eyeballs over dreck? One issue is that our digital devices have not been designed to help us think more efficiently and clearly; almost everything we encounter online has been designed to capture and monetise our attention. Each time you reach for your phone with the intention of completing a simple, discrete, potentially self-improving task, such as checking the news, your primitive hunter-gatherer brain confronts a multibillion-pound tech industry devoted to throwing you off course and holding your attention, no matter what. To extend Christodoulou ’s metaphor, in the same way that one feature of an obesogenic society are food deserts – whole neighbourhoods in which you cannot buy a healthy meal – large parts of the internet are information deserts, in which the only available brain food is junk. In the late 90s the tech consultant Linda Stone, who was working as a professor at New York University, noticed that her students were using technology very differently from her colleagues at Microsoft, where she also worked. While her Microsoft colleagues were disciplined about working on two screens – one for emails, perhaps, and another for Word, or a spreadsheet – her students seemed to be trying to do 20 things at once. She coined the term “continuous partial attention” to describe the stressful, involuntarily state we often find ourselves in when we’re trying to toggle between several cognitively demanding activities, such as responding to emails while on a Zoom call. When I first heard the term I realised that I, like most people I know, live most of my life in a state of continuous partial attention, whether I’m guiltily checking my phone when I’m supposed to be playing with my kids, or incessantly sidetracked by texts and emails when I’m trying to write, or trying to relax while watching Netflix and simultaneously doing an online food shop, still wondering why I feel as chilled-out as an over-microwaved dinner. Digital multitasking makes us feel productive, but this is often illusory. “You have a false sense of being on top of things without ever getting to the bottom of anything,” Stone tells me. It also makes you feel permanently on edge: one study she conducted found that 80% of people experience “screen apnea” when checking their emails: they become so caught up in the endless notifications that they forget to breathe properly. “Your fight or flight system becomes up-regulated, because you’re constantly trying to stay on top of things,” she says, and this hypervigilance has cognitive costs: it makes us more forgetful, worse at making decisions and less attentive.

After all, what matters to tech companies financially is not that you want to be reading what you’re reading, or that you love what you listen to or what you’re looking at, only that you are unwilling or unable to pull yourself away. This is why streaming services such as Netflix crank out bland, formulaic films that are euphemistically labelled “casual viewing” and are literally designed for viewers who aren’t really watching , and Spotify playlists are filled with generic stock music by fake artists, to provide background music, “Chill Out” or “Party” vibes, for listeners who aren’t really listening. In short, the modern internet doesn’t necessarily make you an idiot, but it definitely primes you to act like one. I t is into this climate that generative AI arrived, with an entirely novel offer. Until recently you could only outsource remembering and some data processing to technology; now you can outsource thinking itself. Given that we spend most of our lives feeling overstimulated and frazzled, it’s little wonder that so many have jumped at the chance to let a computer do more things we would have once done for ourselves– such as write work reports or emails, or plan a holiday. As we transition from the internet era to the AI era, what we’re consuming is not only ever more low-value, ultra-processed information, but more information that is essentially predigested, delivered in a way that is designed to bypass important human functions, such as assessing, filtering and summarising information, or actually considering a problem rather than finessing the first solution presented to us. Michael Gerlich, head of the Centre for Strategic Corporate Foresight and Sustainability at SBS Swiss Business School, began studying the impact of generative AI on critical thinking because he noticed the quality of classroom discussions decline. Sometimes he’d set his students a group exercise, and rather than talk to one another they continued to sit in silence, consulting their laptops. He spoke to other lecturers, who had noticed something similar. Gerlich recently conducted a study, involving 666 people of various ages, and found those who used AI more frequently scored lower on critical thinking . (As he notes, to date his work only provides evidence for a correlation between the two: it’s possible that people with lower critical thinking abilities are more likely to trust AI, for example.) Like many researchers, Gerlich believes that, used in the right way, AI can make us cleverer and more creative – but the way most people use it produces bland, unimaginative, factually questionable work. One concern is the so-called “anchoring effect”. If you post a question to generative AI, the answer it gives you sets your brain on a certain mental path and makes you less likely to consider alternative approaches. “I always use the example: imagine a candle. Now, AI can help you improve the candle. It will be the brightest ever, burn the longest, be very cheap and amazing looking, but it will never develop to the lightbulb,” he says. To get from the candle to a lightbulb you need a human who is good at critical thinking, someone who might take a chaotic, unstructured, unpredictable approach to problem solving. When, as has happened in many workplaces, companies roll out tools such as the chatbot Copilot without offering decent AI training, they risk producing teams of passable candle-makers in a world that demands high-efficiency lightbulbs. There is also the bigger issue that adults who use AI as a shortcut have at least benefited from going through the education system in the years before it was possible to get a computer to write your homework for you. One recent British survey found that 92% of university students use AI, and about 20% have used AI to write all or part of an assignment for them. Under these circumstances, how much are they learning? Are schools and universities still equipped to produce creative, original thinkers who will build better, more intelligent societies – or is the education system going to churn out mindless, gullible, AI essay-writing drones? S ome years ago, Matt Miles, a psychology teacher at a high school in Virginia in the US, was sent on a training programme on tech in schools. The teachers were shown a video in which a schoolgirl is caught checking her phone during lessons. In the video, she looks up and says, “You think I’m just on TikTok or playing games. I’m actually in a research room talking to a water researcher from Botswana for a project.” “It’s laughable. You show it to the kids and they all laugh, right?” Miles says. Alarmed at the disconnect between how policymakers view tech in education and what teachers were seeing in the classroom, in 2017 Miles and his colleague Joe Clement, who teaches economics and government at the same school, published Screen Schooled , a book that argued that technology overuse is making kids dumber. In the years since, smartphones have been banned from their classrooms, but students still work from their laptops. “We had one kid tell us, and I think it was pretty insightful, ‘If you see me on my phone, there’s a 0% chance I’m doing something productive. If you see me on my laptop, there’s a 50% chance,’” Miles says. Until the pandemic, many teachers were “rightly sceptical” about the benefits of introducing more technology into the classroom, Faith Boninger, a researcher at the University of Colorado, observes, but when lockdowns forced schools to go online, a new normal was created, and ed tech platforms such as Google Workspace for Education, Kahoot! and Zearn became ubiquitous. With the spread of generative AI came new promises that it could revolutionise education and usher in an era of personalised student learning, while also reducing the workload for teachers. But almost all the research that has found benefits to introducing tech in classrooms is funded by the ed-tech industry, and most large-scale independent research has found that screen time gets in the way of achievement. A global OECD study found, for instance, that the more students use tech in schools, the worse their results . “There is simply no independent evidence at scale for the effectiveness of these tools … in essence what is happening with these technologies is we’re experimenting on children,” says Wayne Holmes, a professor of critical studies of artificial intelligence and education at University College London. “Most sensible people would not go into a bar and meet somebody who says, ‘Hey, I’ve got this new drug. It’s really good for you’ – and just use it. Generally, we expect our medicines to be rigorously tested, we expect them to be prescribed to us by professionals. But suddenly when we’re talking about ed tech, which apparently is very beneficial for children’s developing brains, we don’t need to do that.” What worries Miles and Clement is not only that their students are permanently distracted by their devices, but that they will not develop critical thinking skills and deep knowledge when quick answers are only a click away. Where once Clement would ask his class a question such as, “Where do you think the US ranks in terms of GDP per capita?” and guide his students as they puzzled over the solution, now someone will have Googled the answer before he’s even finished his question. They know students use ChatGPT constantly and get annoyed if they aren’t provided with a digital copy of their assignment, because then they must type rather than copy and paste the relevant questions into an AI assistant or the Google search bar. “Being able to Google something and providing the right answer isn’t knowledge,” Clement says. “And having knowledge is incredibly important so that when you hear something that’s questionable or maybe fake, you think, ‘Wait a minute, that contradicts all the knowledge I have that says otherwise, right?’ It’s no wonder there’s a bunch of idiots walking about who think that the Earth is flat. Like, if you read a flat Earth blog, you think, ‘Ah, that makes a lot of sense’ because you don’t have any understanding or knowledge.” The internet is already awash with conspiracy and misinformation, something that will only become worse as AI hallucinates and produces plausible fakes, and he worries that young people are poorly equipped to navigate it. During the pandemic, Miles says, he found his young son weeping over his school-issued tablet. His son was doing an online maths program and he had been tasked with making six using the fewest number of one, three and five tokens. He kept suggesting using two threes, and the computer kept telling him he was wrong. Miles tried one and five, which the computer accepted. “That’s kind of the nightmare you get with a non-human AI, right?” Miles observes: students often approach topics in unanticipated and interesting ways, but machines struggle to cope with idiosyncrasy. Listening to his story, however, I was struck by a different kind of nightmare. Maybe the dawn of the new golden era of stupidity doesn’t begin when we submit to super-intelligent machines; it starts when we hand over power to dumb ones.

8,Matthew McConaughey and Michael Caine sign voice deal with AI company,Benjamin Lee,2025-11-11T18:10:29.000Z,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/nov/11/matthew-mcconaughey-michael-caine-ai-voice,"The voices of the Oscar-winning actors can now be used to create AI-generated versions in a new deal with ElevenLabs Oscar-winning actors Matthew McConaughey and Michael Caine have both signed a deal with the AI audio company ElevenLabs. The New York-based company can now create AI-generated versions of their voices as part of a bid to solve a “key ethical challenge” in the artificial intelligence industry’s alliance with Hollywood. McConaughey, who has also invested in the company and collaborated with it since 2022, will now allow ElevenLabs to translate his newsletter, Lyrics of Livin’, into a Spanish-language audio version using his voice. In a statement, the Dallas Buyers Club actor said he was “impressed” by ElevenLabs and wanted the partnership to help him “reach and connect with even more people”. ElevenLabs is also launching the Iconic Voices Marketplace, which will allow brands to partner with the company and use officially licensed celebrity voices for AI-generated usage. Caine’s new deal has made his distinctive voice part of its lineup. “For years, I’ve lent my voice to stories that moved people – tales of courage, of wit, of the human spirit,” Caine said in a statement. “Now, I’m helping others find theirs. With ElevenLabs, we can preserve and share voices – not just mine, but anyone’s.” The actor went on to say that the company is “using innovation not to replace humanity, but to celebrate it”, and that it’s “not about replacing voices; it’s about amplifying them”. Caine recently revealed that he would be coming out of retirement for a role opposite Vin Diesel in The Last Witch Hunter 2. Other voices that are part of the marketplace include dead Hollywood stars such as John Wayne, Rock Hudson and Judy Garland as well as those still living such as Liza Minnelli and Art Garfunkel. The list also includes figures such as Amelia Earhart, Babe Ruth, J Robert Oppenheimer, Maya Angelou and Alan Turing. ElevenLabs was recently valued at about $6.6bn. The news follows other celebrity partnership deals with AI such as the many major names who signed up to have their voices used by Meta. Last year, the company revealed a list that includes Judi Dench, John Cena and Kristen Bell. Other celebrities, such as Ashton Kutcher and Leonardo DiCaprio, have also invested in AI companies.

9,A tax roadmap for electric cars,,2025-11-12T18:07:44.000Z,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/nov/12/a-tax-roadmap-for-electric-cars,"Paul F Faupel and Venetia Caine make suggestions about the chancellor’s idea of a pay-per-mile charge on electric cars Rachel Reeves’s proposal to introduce a pay-per-mile tax levy on electric vehicles is idiotic, especially suggesting that hybrid vehicles will have a reduced rate and still pay the usual road tax ( Rachel Reeves considering pay-per-mile tax for electric vehicles in budget, 6 November ). Furthermore, requiring drivers to predict their yearly mileage in advance and then pay or reclaim the difference for actual mileage depending on whether they have underestimated or overestimated it is too cumbersome. If the DVLA is to oversee the collection/repayment system, it will undoubtedly need to recruit more staff or outsource the arrangement, with all the attendant pitfalls that would entail. The fairest way for the taxation of all motorists is to abolish the road tax and introduce a road toll system, as used on the Dartford crossing and the M6 toll road. Automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) would need to be an essential feature. However, the use of an in-car dongle that is linked to either a credit card account or a dedicated debit account (which can be topped up when it reaches a critically low threshold level) would be the pay-as-you-drive element. Dongles could be renewed like the current road tax and preloaded. As vehicles become increasingly IT-sophisticated, the dongle function could be built into their “brains” but only be accessible to the authorised user via a secure password. In hire vehicles this could be governed by the hire period being programmed into the vehicle and automatically wiped on expiry. Paul F Faupel Somersham, Cambridgeshire Nils Pratley says “most EV drivers, one suspects, will see the fairness” in the pay-per-mile idea ( Report, 6 November ). I do, but not at a flat 3p a mile. A few months ago I changed from a city car fuelled by petrol to a city electric car. I am very conscious that it weighs quite a lot more than my earlier car did – about 50% more. But by comparison with most electric cars it is light, and its wear on the roads is slight. If there is to be a tax on electric cars, then it should be progressive – according to car size. Also, I do already pay a fuel tax. It’s called VAT on the electricity I draw from the grid each time I transfer “fuel” from my domestic supply.

The records, running to hundreds of pages, appeared on a website unrelated to the government-sponsored organisation, which operates the Tate Modern and Tate Britain galleries in London, Tate St Ives in Cornwall and Tate Liverpool. The data includes details of applicants’ current employers and education, and relates to the Tate’s hunt for a website developer in October 2023. Information about 111 individuals is included. They are not named but their referees are, sometimes with mobile numbers and personal email addresses. It was not immediately clear how long the data had been circulating online. Max Kohler, a 29-year-old computer programmer, discovered his data appeared in the leak on Thursday after one of the referees on his application was emailed by a stranger who had seen the data dump online. Kohler found that it included his last salary, the name of his current employer, and names, emails and addresses of his other referees, as well as lengthy answers he had given to job application questions. “It’s very disappointing and disillusioning,” he said. “You spend time putting in all this sensitive information, salaries from previous jobs, home addresses, and they don’t take care of this information, and have it floating around in public. “They should take it down, apologise and there should be a report into how this happened and what they are going to do to ensure it does not happen again. It must be mistrained staff or process error.” The number of data security incidents reported to the UK’s Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) continues to rise . In 2022 there were just over 2,000 incidents reported per quarter; that has increased to more than 3,200 between April and June this year. Kate Brimsted, a partner at the law firm Shoosmiths and an expert in data privacy, information law and cyber security, said: “A breach doesn’t have to be deliberate, and while the ransomware attacks get the headlines, the majority of breaches today are through error. It’s just as important to have checks and processes as part of organisations’ day-to-day practices. We are all fallible. It’s really hard work managing your own data. It is difficult and sometimes boring, but is important.” The ICO, which regulates data protection in the UK, said: “Organisations must notify the ICO within 72 hours of becoming aware of a personal data breach, unless it does not pose a risk to people’s rights and freedoms. If an organisation decides that a breach doesn’t need to be reported they should keep their own record of it and be able to explain why it wasn’t reported if necessary.” Sign up to First Edition Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion A spokesperson for Tate said: “We review all reports thoroughly and are investigating the matter.

11,Scrutiny grows over LA fire origins after bombshell report: ‘Our Pearl Harbor moment’,Nick Visser,2025-11-16T12:00:34.000Z,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/16/la-fire-palisades-report,"Reports that fire crews were ordered to leave original site of blaze prompt tough questions for city and LAFD leaders C oncerns over a small brush fire that reignited days later into the mammoth Palisades fire – the most destructive in Los Angeles history – have grown in recent weeks amid reports that firefighters were ordered to leave the original site of the smaller blaze despite their concerns the ground was still smoldering. Now, questions remain about how leaders at the Los Angeles fire department responded to a fire that leveled entire communities , and who within the agency knew about concerns the fire could still pose a threat. A former LA city councilor says the aftermath and recovery effort should serve as a Pearl Harbor moment for the city, which should never again be in a position with flames encroaching on all sides. The LA Times has published a series of bombshell revelations about the initial response to that first blaze, the Lachman fire, in recent weeks, citing text messages revealing that firefighters spoke with their battalion chief shortly after it broke out in the early hours of New Year’s Day. The small fire – just 8 acres – was largely extinguished hours later. But, the Times reports, firefighters were told to roll up their hoses and leave a day later: a move that was made despite reporting to their superior that it was a “bad idea” to leave the burn scar because of visible smoldering – some rocks and tree stumps were still hot to the touch. The LAFD previously maintained the Lachman fire was “dead out” before firefighters moved on, saying they had “ cold-trailed ” it several times, feeling with their hands for any hotspots to detect any remaining fire. Any new blaze that arose from the ashes would “be a phenomenon”, an assistant fire chief said at the time. The Palisades fire ignited five days later. Flames whipped by 100mph winds ravaged large parts of the Pacific Palisades, Malibu and Topanga, ultimately killing 12 people and destroying more than 6,800 structures. A man has been arrested and charged with maliciously igniting the Lachman fire. He faces three federal arson charges and has pleaded not guilty . New details on the concerns about the response to the initial Lachman blaze have since been reported by the LA Times, who reported earlier this month that the department kept the details around the battalion chief’s order to pack up a secret. At least one official learned of the concerns by June. Those details are not included in a 70-page after-action report on the Palisades fire that was released in early October. That report only notes that the fire “began in the Santa Monica Mountains below the burn scar of the previous Lachman fire” and “ultimately ravaged the areas of Pacific Palisades, Topanga, and Malibu, remaining uncontained until 31 January 2025”. “This deadly fire, fueled by category 1 hurricane winds, was among a series of 11 wind-driven fires that occurred over the next three weeks, devastating the southern California region,” the report reads. Mayor calls for investigation The growing confusion surrounding the timeline and the LAFD’s response prompted Los Angeles mayor Karen Bass to order an investigation into the Lachman fire last month. Bass asked the department’s interim chief, Ronnie Villanueva, to investigate the origins of the blaze, writing to say the accounts were “tremendously alarming” last month. “Make no mistake: our city’s firefighters are heroes every day. We owe it to them and the people of Los Angeles to make sure that their fire department is led, organized and ready for whatever emergencies may arise,” Bass said in a 31 October letter. But while many investigations have looked into the origin of the January wildfires, Bass said a full account of the response before and after the Palisades fire would help the department adapt and reform. “A full understanding of the Lachman fire response is essential to an accurate accounting of what occurred during the January wildfires,” Bass wrote. “This will continue to guide our ongoing reforms, which include enhancing pre-deployment protocols, strengthening interagency coordination, upgrading communications technology and expanding training at all staff levels.” Bass, who is up for reelection next year, recently appointed Jamie Moore as the permanent chief to lead the fire department. Her office said this week Moore would spearhead that investigation, and Moore said Wednesday he would support a full, independent probe into the handling of the Lachman fire. “Recent media attention surrounding the January wildfires has created understandable mistrust, and it must be addressed directly,” Moore, whose position must still be approved by the LA city council, told a meeting of the body’s public safety committee this week. “I fully support Mayor Bass’s request for an independent investigation into the Los Angeles fire department’s response to the Lachman fire, recognizing that transparency and accountability are vital to ensure that we learn from every incident.” He said he was committed to a “fair and thorough process” that helps “restore confidence in our fire department.” “Our members were not listened to and were not heard,” Moore said. “That is why I am supporting Mayor Bass’s request for an independent investigation into the Lachman fire, because I want to get to the bottom of it.” Bass’s office and the Los Angeles fire department did not reply to requests for comment. ‘Pearl Harbor’ of fires warrants independent inquiry, critics say Zev Yaroslavsky, who spent 20 years on the LA city council and 20 years as a member of the county board of supervisors, said the events surrounding the Palisades fire and the reporting afterwards were “still crying out for that kind of independent analysis, not only to get the truth, but also to inspire confidence in the people of the county, the city, all of us”. “You’ve got to get an independent panel of people who do not have any connection to the fire departments of this region … a small group of people who take a look at what went right, and what went wrong,” he told the Guardian. “Something always goes wrong in a fire.” Yaroslavsky, who is now the director of the Los Angeles Initiative at UCLA’s school of public affairs, went on: “Every incident has a post-incident analysis, and something on this scale, it has to be looked at in a very different way. This is kind of like 9/11, it’s like Pearl Harbor for the fire services.” Even recent events with emergency warning systems pointed to a need for the LAFD to better address how it could improve in the wake of the Palisades fire, Yaroslavsky said. This week, he said he got an alert on his iPhone meant to be a test of emergency systems for South Pasadena, but instead the message was sent to everyone in LA county, about 10 million people . “Something is haywire in the communications systems. I mean, there are a lot of things that need to be looked at, and should have been looked at long before now,” he said. Bass’ office has stressed that Los Angeles has taken many steps to implement new tools and processes to improve preparedness and response to fires, including leadership changes, improved training and better preparation before a fire starts. Yaroslavsky said the city has two highly trained fire departments in the LAFD and the LA county fire department, and said firefighters did a heroic job when the Palisades fire broke out. “These are two of the best fire departments in the world, and they were ambushed by a windstorm that was unprecedented in our history,” he said. But, he added, many questions remain and Bass and the LAFD need to provide answers as communities continue to rebuild. “I think the morale has been shaken to the core in Altadena and the Palisades,” Yaroslavsky said, also referencing the destructive Eaton fire at the same time. “I think a legitimate question is what did everybody know, and when did they know it. “There’s no question that the mayor has suffered politically for this. She should be judged not by what she did on day one, but what she was going to do in the subsequent days, and the rebuilding and getting to the bottom of this.

Legal experts say Ghislaine Maxwell’s alleged prison life is uncommon,Victoria Bekiempis,2025-11-16T13:00:32.000Z,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/16/ghislaine-maxwell-low-security-prison-treatment,"Maxwell is serving a 20-year sentence for her role in Jeffrey Epstein’s sex-trafficking of teen girls – and her treatment is prompting speculation S ince Ghislaine Maxwell ’s controversial transfer to a low-security prison camp this summer, her time at Texas’s FPC Bryan has prompted uproar over alleged favorable treatment – including claims this week that she was provided custom-made meals, access to a puppy and as much toilet paper as she wants. Some of the recent accusations were in a 9 November letter thatJamie Raskin sent to Donald Trump. The Democratic representative’s letter, which cited whistleblower information, demanded answers about Maxwell’s conditions – including whether Trump directed anyone in his administration to give her special treatment. Whistleblower disclosures, Raskin said, also revealed that Maxwell was working on a “commutation application” with Trump’s administration. Maxwell is currently serving a 20-year sentence for her role in Jeffrey Epstein ’s sex trafficking of teen girls, a scandal that has dogged Trump for years and has recently hit a feverish pitch during his second term. The special treatment and the alleged request for a commutation of her sentence has prompted feverish speculation as to why Maxwell is getting such treatment and whether or not Trump could pardon her. The disgraced socialite’s team on Friday denied that she was seeking clemency. Though both Maxwell and Trump have denied the US president was involved in, or knew of, Epstein’s wrongdoing, the former British socialite remains at the center of the scandal. That was heightened this week when amid of trove of released emails there was a message between Epstein and Maxwell that referred to Trump as “the dog that hasn’t barked” and said he had spent considerable time with one of the victims. Certainly, Maxwell’s treatment after she was transferred from Florida to her new, much more relaxed prison in Texas is eye-catching. More perks allegedly afforded to Maxwell included a special area where she can receive visitors, replete with “an assortment of snacks and refreshments for her guests”, and treating the warden as “her personal secretary and administrative assistant”. CNN reported she could have unlimited toilet paper. As for the aforementioned puppy? “An inmate who trains puppies to become service dogs was instructed to provide one to Maxwell for a time so she could play with the puppy, even though neither inmates nor staff are ordinarily allowed to pet the service dogs in training. “The deference and servility to Ms Maxwell have reached such preposterous levels that one of the top officials at the facility has complained that he is ‘sick of having to be Maxwell’s bitch’,” Raskin also said. This application, Raskin said, demonstrated “either that Ms Maxwell is herself requesting you release her from her 20-year prison sentence for her role as a coconspirator in Jeffrey Epstein’s international child sex-trafficking ring, or that this child sex predator now holds such tremendous sway in the second Trump administration that you and your DOJ will follow her clemency recommendations”. While the White House has previously said “pardoning Ghislaine Maxwell is not something [Trump] has thought about”, legal veterans told the Guardian that this kind of alleged treatment is uncommon, and raises the specter of still more favorable developments for Maxwell. “The government isn’t going to give an incarcerated prisoner all of these perks in exchange for nothing,” said Eric Faddis, founder of the Colorado law firm Varner Faddis and a former prosecutor. “What it tells me is that the government believes they received something of value from Ghislaine and this is sort of her reward.” Faddis said that he had seen inmates improve their lot by cooperating with the government and providing information deemed “useful” but not to the extent alleged. “It seems like the government gave, perhaps special preference, to Ghislaine based on the ostensible weight of the information she provided and its value.” Neama Rahmani, founder of West Coast Trial Lawyers and a former federal prosecutor, said “this is not typical”. Sex trafficking and other sex-related crimes are considered crimes of violence. Inmates convicted of them are typically isolated from the general population because they are considered dangerous and “they’re also at increased risk of being attacked or killed by other inmates”. “They’re segregated, they’re in administrative custody. They’re generally not in a low-security facility with the general population,” Rahani said. “The fact that she’s allegedly getting these special meals, visits, puppy access – that is not standard, that is not typical in these types of cases.” If the allegations about special treatment were true, including seeming irregularity surrounding her placement, it could be a quid pro quo, such as a “we’re gonna give you benefits because you’re keeping your mouth shut and not implicating people in power or with money”. That said, it could be some completely benign, such as “there’s not a whole lot of placements for female inmates in the federal system, and this is the best the BOP had”. John Day, a former prosecutor in New Mexico who founded the John Day Law Office, voiced similar sentiments about the alleged perks. “Even if it’s 50% exaggerated, it’s still outrageous – and it indicates some type of favorable treatment that no one else could get unless you were connected in the right ways,” he said. “These are the kind of privileges that are given to someone who has done something in return,” Day continued. This is not normal treatment for the crime she was convicted of, and it raises all sorts of questions about the propriety of it, and who’s behind it, and what the motive is.” Larry Levine, founder of Wall Street Prison Consultants and a former federal inmate, was skeptical of the whistleblower allegations. With special meal claims, for example, Levine said inmates figure out how to prepare and eat bespoke meals, including by pilfering food from the kitchen. “I used to have omelets and chicken breast and veal parmesandelivered to my cell that was made by an inmate,” he said. “It was ‘special’ food because no one else had it.” Levine said it was “possible” BOP staff were preparing food for Maxwell but thought it very unlikely. “That would cause big, big, big problems with the inmates … Why is she getting this and we have to eat this crap here?” he said. “It would cause civil unrest in there.” He also wasn’t shocked by the claim that Maxwell received visitors in a cordoned-off area. In a visiting room, where there are many inmates and visitors, “everyone’s going to be gawking at her”, and officials might determine that keeping her separate fosters safety and security. “I’ve seen that happen before.” Levine was emphatic, however, that Maxwell’s move to the Texas prison was “unprecedented”. Under Bureau of Prisons guidelines, sex offenders present safety concerns that do not permit their incarceration at low-security institutions such as Bryan. “There’s your big special privilege.” It is unclear what these alleged privileges mean for Maxwell’s future, if anything. Levine noted that thousands seek commutations and that the process is backed up. “So could she ask? Sure, but I don’t think she’s going to get it.” That said, “with Trump, everything’s in the air.” Rahmani said he believed that Maxwell was seeking a commutation, especially given that the US supreme court declined to hear her appeal. “There’s no doubt in my mind that Maxwell and her team are lobbying the president. I would be shocked if the president were actually to do this, but you never know when it comes to Trump.” He pointed to Maxwell’s sit-down with Todd Blanche, the deputy attorney general who previously served as Trump’s personal lawyer. “It is pretty rare for someone with his title and position in the DoJ to handle a case personally,” he said. “So you know, she does have some access that most folks do not.” Given the cumulative circumstances, Day said, “You take it all together, nobody should be surprised if the next step is a commutation or a pardon. “That seems to be where all the arrows are pointing and if you follow all the breadcrumbs.” Maxwell’s team insisted that she was taking steps outside of seeking clemency, claiming that she will soon be filing a habeas petition in Manhattan federal court to challenge her conviction. “In the four years since the verdict new evidence has indeed come to light – and is continuing to do so,” Leah Saffian, counsel to Maxwell, said in a statement. “Habeas petitions are distinct from petitions to the supreme court, in that they relate to prisoners’ rights and conviction challenges,” the statement said at another point. “Prior to any such [pardon] application a prisoner needs to demonstrate that all possible avenues of appeal have been exhausted.” The Guardian has reached out to the White House and the Department of Justice for comment. The White House pointed to comments from Karoline Leavitt, the press secretary, earlier this week when a reported asked about whether Trump was considering a pardon for Maxwell. “He’s answered this repeatedly. It’s not something he’s talking about or even thinking about at this moment in time. I can assure you of that,” she said. The justice department referred the Guardian to the Bureau of Prisons. The Bureau of Prisons said in a statement that “allegations of misconduct, including any suggestion of preferential treatment, are taken seriously and thoroughly investigated” through internal processes. It added that violations of this policy can result in disciplinary action that can include firing and prosecution. The BOP’s standards of employee conduct “explicitly prohibits all staff from providing preferential treatment to any inmate”, the agency said.

Harbor scored on an 80-yard reception in the second quarter and entered the tunnel after the score, appearing to walk off a leg injury. As he and three of his teammates, including running back Oscar Adaway III, were walking back to the field, the trooper walked in between Harbor and Adaway and bumped into them . The trooper pointed at Harbor and Adaway, appearing to admonish them. Harbor was quickly pushed away by a teammate as they continued make their way towards the field.

The Texas Department of Public Safety Department, which employs the trooper, issued a statement saying he had been sent home from Kyle Field, Texas A&M’s home stadium. “Our Office of Inspector General is also aware of the incident and will be further looking into the matter. No additional information will be released at this time,” the statement read. South Carolina head coach Shane Beamer said he was pleased action had been taken against the trooper. “Got a ton of respect for the people here in College Station,” Beamer said after the game. “They’re just a first-class operation, everybody. From a game operation standpoint, they really do a great job. They’re first-class people, so appreciate them handling that the right way, sending [the trooper] home.” Texas A&M rallied from 27 points down to complete a remarkable 31-30 win over South Carolina to remain undefeated this season. Harbor left the game in the fourth quarter after sustaining a suspected chest injury when another player landed on him while he made a catch. Beamer said the 20-year-old was taken to hospital as a precautionary measure accompanied by his father Jean, a former professional soccer player who won 15 caps for the US men’s national team. Nyck Harbor won the 2023 Franklin D Watkins Memorial Award , a prize which honors African American high schoolers who excel in athletics, academics and charity work. Aside from his football career, Harbor has won national titles in track, volunteered at a soup kitchen and worked with Generosity Global, which campaigns to improve women’s health in Africa.

15,"‘I try not to get him started on politics!’: power couples on rows, rules and who really does the housework",Kitty Drake,2025-11-16T06:00:24.000Z,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/nov/16/power-couples-on-romance-rows-and-who-does-the-housework,"As fewer people tie the knot, four well-known married couples share their secrets, from film director Bruce Robinson and artist Sophie Windham to writers Roxane Gay and Debbie Millman ‘My first impression? Deeply uncool’ Bruce Robinson – best known as the writer and director of Withnail and I – met artist Sophie Windham at an Italian restaurant in London in 1982. He proposed three days later. They have been married for 42 years and still live and work side by side in the Welsh borders. They have two grown up children, Lily and Willoughby . Sophie Bruce has been writing obsessively since I met him – and anybody who wasn’t creative themselves would have found that hard to put up with. We cut short our honeymoon after only three days because he had a script deadline, and today he still works until 10pm many nights. Because I’m a painter I can relate to that. He’s not pissed off if I vanish into my studio for the day. When our children were little, I was very much “mum looking after the kids” and managing to illustrate books in my time off, and Bruce’s work came first. He was writing script after script, which was just as well because I couldn’t support a family on what I was earning. Now that our children have left home, things are more settled; we both spend the same number of hours working. Sometimes that means we spend all day apart and only come together at dinner time. Bruce likes good food, but if I’m not there he won’t eat. I think it’s because he spent so many years swilling red wine and chain-smoking. If you’re drinking a lot of wine, you don’t want to eat. Bruce isn’t drinking at the moment and quit the fags years ago, but he still never thinks about food. At lunchtime sometimes he will eat a pickled onion or an ice-cream. Then I cook a meal for us both in the evening. My first impression of Bruce was that he was deeply uncool. It was the era of post-punk and all my friends had sticking-up hair, whereas Bruce was wearing a low-cut shirt and these awful cowboy boots. He also talked at me for 40 minutes about how much he hated Margaret Thatcher, and his ranting was a bit offputting. He still rants about Thatcher over dinner, but you can’t say I wasn’t warned. I try not to get him started on politics. Seeing him open the Guardian is my signal to run. Through all of it I have remained very much in love with Bruce, because at his core he is a very kind, sensitive, funny person. I remember friends saying, “I’m not in love with my husband any more” but I could never relate to that. For many years I was obsessed with Bruce, really, and I think he was with me. It’s slightly different now we’ve been together for so long. It’s grown into a kind of deep love, rather than the besotted kind. Bruce Sophie doesn’t really annoy me or upset me in any way, even though I know she cannot say the same. The only time I get a tiny bit frustrated is when she shrugs off what is obviously a political breakthrough from me. She says it’s because she’s heard all of my political breakthroughs before, but that’s not true because I get new ones all the time. We bicker a little bit, but I think we still genuinely enjoy each other’s company, even after all these years. We live in the countryside and we are very lucky to have a lot of space, so we can escape from one another when we need to. Escaping might be part of how we make our marriage work. We’re not too demanding of each other’s time. I am one of the few people in England who doesn’t own a mobile phone, and we don’t even really watch TV. I can’t stand all of that. Sometimes we read our books in the evenings, although Sophie likes novels, which I rarely do. I read textbooks. We’ve worked on children’s books together, but I think one reason we are so compatible is because what we do is so different. There’s never been any competitiveness – if she’d been a writer, too, we might have spent all day arguing about commas. Soph can sit in her studio and have whole telephone conversations while painting. If I even have distant voices in the background, I can’t write. But we understand each other. She has to shut the door on me to work well and I have to shut the door on her. I must admit to a variation of opinion in respect of our affection for red wine. I like to write on it because it shuts out the voice that says, “You can’t write that. You can’t.” I used to have a glass before I had my toothpaste in the morning, to get in the mood to write. Not the best of memories. But the fact that we are still together, and still love each other, must mean we got something right? Sophie Windham’s next exhibition is at The Table in Hay-on-Wye, 4-17 May 2026. Bruce Robinson is directing the play of Withnail and I, due to open in London in the spring. ‘ I often think, look at this woman go!’ Author Roxane Gay’s first contact with designer and podcaster Debbie Millman was a series of emails about her work that Millman sent and Gay never answered. They married during the pandemic and now split their time between Los Angeles and New York . Roxane About eight years ago, Debbie wrote me a beautiful email saying my book Hunger had resonated with her. She said it felt like I was writing the story of her own body. I remember feeling curious about her. But I’d never met Debbie at that point. She was just a stranger, writing to my work email account. Also, I was in a relationship at the time, so I didn’t respond. Luckily, Debbie is persistent and she took my silence in her stride. Over the next two years, she continued to email me once in a while, about pieces I had written and talks I had given. Finally, a mutual friend put in a good word for her, and by that point my relationship situation had changed, so I thought: what the hell? Debbie sent me a very formal message saying she would like to “take me out on a proper date” and I was charmed by the sentence construction of that. I was 43, and no one had ever asked me out so officially before. Debbie wanted the whole nine yards. Dinner! A proper date! She was very clear about her romantic intentions, and I appreciate clarity. When we first met, Debbie was about to set off on a one-month round-the-world trip, and I found it very sexy that she didn’t alter her itinerary in any way to see me. Now, travel is a big part of our life together – even though I used to be the kind of person who was like: why go anywhere when we have a TV right here? Debbie and I travel well together because I’m the one who does all the organising. She has all the ideas, but I execute them. She’ll be like: let’s go to the top of the world. And I’m like: let’s not, but OK. Then I make the arrangements. That said, if there’s anything wrong with our room or flight, Debbie is the one who goes and confronts someone about it. People always look at me thinking I’m the problem, but Debbie doesn’t tolerate any nonsense. I love that she is this way. I call her my little enforcer. Debbie is a typical Scorpio: fierce and headstrong. When we first started dating, we were walking down the street in Manhattan and this guy bumped into her, but it felt purposeful. She grabbed him, shoved him right back and said, “Watch where you’re going.” It was so impressive. I’ve spent my life walking next to the buildings on the sidewalk, thinking “Don’t take up too much space” but Debbie is the exact opposite. To be fair, I am in charge of planning because I’m a lot more picky about where we stay. Debbie would be happy in a bug-ridden yurt. But my people are from Haiti. I’ve experienced all the discomfort I need in one lifetime. We went on an expedition to Mongolia together and you could either sleep in the Gobi desert with no plumbing or in the Shangri-La in Ulaanbaatar. Guess which one I chose? I prefer to do things with Debbie, but I also don’t want to hold her back from experiences she wants that I have no interest in. We’re both old enough and set in our ways enough to accept each other. There’s no professional imbalance between us because we are both at the apex of our careers. We just finally opened a joint bank account, but we both have our own sources of income, so we don’t have arguments about money. Of course, you can still make it work if there are imbalances, but being equals makes things much easier. I’m not even just talking about finances. I’m talking about intelligence, too. In everyday life I often look at Debbie and think, look at this woman go! Perhaps our relationship works partly because we met when we were older. Thirty years ago, I wouldn’t have been ready. I was still in deep trauma recovery, whereas now I’m more able to communicate. Debbie is very feelings-forward, whereas I’m like: my feelings are inside me and they’re never coming out. I know Debbie does not like me clamming up, but she will keep asking, because she loves with such fierceness. Debbie doesn’t think of herself in this way, but she is extremely passionate. Being loved by her is so all-engulfing and complete it can sometimes actually be a little terrifying because I think: it’s just me. How can you love me so much? Debbie Persistence is definitely one of my character traits, except when it comes to romance. With Roxane, though, everything felt different. From the beginning, I felt so in tune with her that I was never tempted to act out of insecurity or play games. With Roxane, I felt calm for the first time ever. I’ve been married twice before. Third time’s the charm. My previous spouses were men and, no surprise, they didn’t work out. I always had a suspicion I was gay, but I had a very difficult upbringing and the thought of being any more “different” than I already felt was too much to bear. With two marriages behind me, I never thought I’d marry again – but I also knew I loved Roxane and she was my soulmate and lifelong partner. She had always wanted her father to walk her down the aisle – and to make her happy, I’d do anything. Now, marriage feels different. I love being married to her. I have a complicated relationship with my family, so I’ve felt lucky to be embraced by Roxane’s parents so thoroughly. We love to travel together as a group. We lost Roxane’s mom last year, which has been very hard. We are hoping that her father will move in with us. We have a guest house attached to our home that would be perfect, although he understandably doesn’t want to give up his independence. But we spend a lot of time with him. We also have our cats and dog to care for. The pets are really in charge at home. Roxane and I are just tenants. We try to be cognisant of when we each go into deep loss mode. I’m a crier. Roxane says I’m good at telling her precisely what I need in a difficult moment. Sometimes I’ll say, “I don’t need you to fix it.” So then she just listens. Chris Rock has a standup routine where he’s talking about how his girlfriend comes home from work, starts talking about her day, but doesn’t actually want any feedback; she just wants him to listen to her complain about her friend or colleague or boss. So Chris goes into what he calls “That bitch be crazy” mode. So sometimes Roxane says, “Do you want feedback, or do you want ‘That bitch be crazy’?” If it’s the latter, she will just nod and listen and declare, “Oh my God!” or, “How dare she?!” Roxane isn’t so forthcoming with her own emotions, but I always say, “I know there is something going on. So unless you want me to keep asking you, you have to just tell me.” She knows I won’t give up. Roxane and I are very different, but there are also so many things we have in common. Like the fact that we both love live theatre. We also love going to see art and music together. We are both night owls, which is convenient. I actually go to sleep slightly earlier than Roxane, but she sits in bed next to me and plays online puzzles. When I was younger, I used to fantasise about what kind of person out there in the world would be right for me. I used to have a vision of someone being really amused by me – and that is Roxane! She really is amused by me. We laugh together all the time, even at the silly little songs I make up. She helps me love being myself, because she just seems to enjoy who I am so much.

Two decades , two children and countless gigs later, life has a different rhythm. Laura When I got pregnant, eight years into our relationship, it was a culture shock. Then I got pregnant again, and being a touring musician became even more logistically crazy. I’d be backstage with my boobs filling up, desperately trying to find a quiet spot to pump. We wouldn’t be able to manage to make things work day-to-day if we didn’t have a huge familial support network. Jon comes from a working-class Sheffield family, where it’s normal to have loads of aunties and cousins pitch in and lend a hand with childcare. My parents help a lot, too. Spending kid-free time together is important – but it can be equally important for John and I to spend a bit of time apart. I sing comedy songs with another band as a side project and Jon is always bigging that up. I also recently did a counselling course and Jon was so supportive of that. He said, “Don’t even question it. We will make the hours work, no matter what.” The wheels came off our marriage a bit during Covid because we were trapped at home together, in each other’s faces all day, with no individual creative outlets at all. Jon is a messy fucker. And in normal life, I’m like, what does that matter? Jon loves me, and he tells me I’m beautiful every day, and he tells me I’m a great mum. But when you’re at home together all day, dirty pants at the side of the bed suddenly seem so disrespectful. I’d look at Jon’s pants and be like: you don’t respect me at all! At one point during Covid, Jon bubbled with a group of other musicians and went off to make a record. In one sense it was great because it meant we no longer had to panic about money, but then again: I was all alone home schooling the kids. We’d speak on the phone and Jon would be telling me about some caviar the label had provided for the musicians in the studio that day, and I’d be sitting there eating fish fingers and chips. The resentment worked both ways, though. Jon was missing our kids and feeling envious of my close bond with them, whereas I was madly jealous he got to have a poo without somebody watching him. During that rough patch, we developed a few new ways of communicating that still help us today. We use a traffic light system to tell each other about our tension levels. So I will say to Jon, “I’m on amber today, babe. Feeling a bit antsy and something could tip me over to red.” Or, “I’m on red: be aware.” Jon has got better at saying, “What can I do to help?” Even if I pretend I’m fine and handling everything perfectly, he’s learned to step in and organise things so I can go for a walk or see my mum for the afternoon. I think it can be tempting to just muddle through a bad period of a marriage. You let the difficult things lie dormant and hope that ignoring them will somehow make them go away – but they don’t. I’m a bit of an ostrich and tend to bury my feelings. Jon is actually better at being open. What I love about him is that he wears his heart on his sleeve. He has this zest for life that is just infectious. His enthusiasm is infuriating sometimes, too. But I love it. Jon The reality of being married to someone for 16 years is that it’s hard sometimes. We’re in a band together, and before the kids came along we were partners in crime. We could be completely spontaneous. It would be like: do you want to go to Vietnam tomorrow? And Laura’s reaction was always just, yes! Let’s get off then! But now, there is an implicit understanding that when push comes to shove, Laura will stay at home with our children and I will go and do the gig. That creates a weird dynamic where I get to do all the “fun stuff”, but Laura gets to be with the kids and get all the cuddles. I miss our children so I get jealous. I do have to go away, by virtue of being the frontman . I need to gig and earn money. But there’s an element of sexism to it all that I recognise. To this day, my mum will come over and if the house is a mess because we’ve both been on tour, there will be the unspoken assumption that it’s all Laura’s fault. Covid was a difficult time for us. We were together constantly, but it felt like we never sat down and had any proper conversations. By the time we got the kids to bed, we were too exhausted from home schooling. I’ve always had a side to me that is angry. Not violent, but argumentative. I’d walk around in a rage, but I found it hard to know what I was actually feeling. During that time, we saw a counsellor who helped me articulate “I feel sad” or “I feel jealous”. Sometimes I think your job as a partner, and as a parent, is to be a kind of human sieve. You take what you saw the couples in your family doing and try to keep the good bits, but sieve out the bad. Laura is more emotionally intelligent than I am, but she has taught me a lot. She has made me a better human in that regard. Before I got together with Laura, I didn’t really believe in marriage. I thought it was just a silly piece of paper and a waste of money. But I remember one night Laura gave me a lecture that changed my mind. She said we celebrate a lot of things in life that don’t technically mean anything. Like getting another year older. Why shouldn’t you celebrate finding the person who you want to share children with and tell your deepest, darkest secrets to? What could be a better cause of celebration, really? Reverend and the Makers’ eighth studio album, Is This How Happiness Feels?, is released on 24 April 2026 through Distiller Records. ‘It’s not about every day being perfect’ Novelists Greg and Kate Mosse met at school at 16, reconnected on a train in their late 20s, and married at 40 when their now grown up children, Felix and Martha, were seven and nine. Caring for elderly parents means their home in Chichester is always hectic. Kate Since Greg’s mum moved in with us in 1999, and later my parents, too, there have been many birds in the nest. That might put a strain on some marriages, but not ours because we’ve known each other’s families always. We have the capacity to love and care for each other’s parents unconditionally, as well as our own. Greg cared for my dad, who had Parkinson’s, and I look after Greg’s mum, whom I love dearly. Caring has been a privilege, not a burden, though it’s left us with less freedom than most people in their 60s. We can never be spontaneous, but we’ve learned to carve out time, just us, even if it’s just a pub lunch. I had always thought of marriage as a patriarchal trap. But when people kept asking whether Greg was the father of our children, we got married in a low-key way. It didn’t change our relationship – having children was the most significant decision we’ve made. Neither of us had planned to be parents, but we knew we wanted children together. People often assume that Greg did most of the childcare because he worked fewer hours and I was in the public eye as a novelist, but everything has always been shared. One of us steps forward while the other steps back, depending on what’s needed. And, over time, it balances out. We support one another 100% in whatever we’re doing, and we’re equally proud of each other’s successes. We respect each other. We still find ourselves sitting on the sofa, giggling at the same thing. What I admire most about Greg is his integrity. His sense of self has never been predicated on his work or what other people think of him. It takes a lot for men to escape the idea of being the breadwinner, but Greg’s work is about fulfilment and satisfaction, which makes his enjoyment of what he does wonderful. Because we’re in the same industry, we share our novels with each other first and know what it all means. But we have very different writing schedules. I obsess while I’m writing a book, then collapse once it’s done. Greg is very methodical. I don’t talk about my work while I’m in the middle of it. Greg carries his more lightly. If you’re lucky to find a person who suits you so completely, it’s not about every day being perfect. As carers, there’s often a lot of pressure on us, but we don’t take those things out on one another. We don’t always agree, but when we disagree, it’s not in a way that festers or matters in the long term. Sure, it’s annoying when you want to buy more cushions, but your husband says we already have too many. Or that wherever I put something in the dishwasher, Greg will move it. But it’s about letting those things go, while still standing your ground. We don’t give weight to things that don’t matter. Greg Kate’s home life was secure and solid, whereas mine had been disruptive and unanchored. Coming back together, Kate offered me the long-term sense of stability I’d been missing. I took her surname in August 1989, before we got married – it was important to me to have the same name as her and our children. Living with our parents and children has been difficult at times because different generations have different wants and needs. When our kids were teenagers, life was like one eternal Glastonbury for them, while the older generation wanted their bowl of Alpen at the same time every day. And as their health declined, we had to manage life around helping to shower them, dressing wounds and arranging carers. As a couple, we had to plan spontaneity. Emotionally, I didn’t need marriage. From the moment we reconnected on the train, I had complete confidence in our relationship. We support each other, and that partnership has always guided our decisions. When Kate was starting out as a writer, I trained to be a teacher because it made the most sense for our family. And as she became more successful, I stopped teaching full-time and kept afternoons free to support our home life. We have different tastes in many things – someone once said the only thing we have in common is each other – but we don’t argue about small things or look for reasons to be annoyed. Even if the house is full of cushions, the dishwasher is stacked incorrectly or the fridge is overflowing with food, the way she likes it. Kate has an extraordinary capacity to give, and I have been one of her good works. For that, I will always be grateful.

16,The banality of evil: how Epstein’s powerful friends normalised him,David Smith,2025-11-16T14:00:36.000Z,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/16/jeffrey-epstein-powerful-friends,"Long after his conviction for sexual abuse, people in royalty, academia, business, journalism and politics sought his ear He got by with a little help from his friends. From British royalty to White House alumni, from a Silicon Valley investor to a leftwing academic, connections and influence were the ultimate currency for Jeffrey Epstein . Yet none appeared to challenge Epstein over his horrific crimes. If silence is complicity, the casual disdain of the elite circles he moved in spoke volumes. Emails released this week by the House of Representatives’ oversight committee revealed how Epstein maintained contact with business executives, reporters, academics and political players despite his 2008 guilty plea for soliciting prostitution from an underage girl. Epstein’s death – he was charged with sex trafficking in 2019 and killed himself in prison a month later – has long been a magnet for conspiracy theories but the documents expose a reality less about a shadowy cabal and more about a system of power that operates in plain sight, indifferent to conviction or consequence. Spanning 2009 to 2019, Epstein’s short, choppy emails laden with spelling and grammatical errors do little to implicate his contacts – including Donald Trump – in any criminal activities. But they do show some acquaintances supporting him during legal troubles while others sought introductions or advice on everything from dating to oil prices. Their bantering, frivolous tone implies that Epstein would have felt still welcome as a member of polite society, receiving no social incentive to change his ways. Far from being ostracised as a sex offender, he was normalised. In several messages in 2018, he advised longtime Trump ally Steve Bannon on his political tour of Europe that year. Bannon forwarded Epstein a news clip that described the German media as “underestimating” Bannon and saying he was “As Dangerous as Ever”. “luv it,” Epstein responded. Epstein wrote that he’d just spoken to “one of the country leaders that we discussed” and that “we should lay out a strategy plan. . how much fun.” Several months later, Epstein sent some advice: “If you are going to play here , you’ll have to spend time, europe by remote doesn’t work.” “its doable but time consuming,” Epstein continued in a follow-up email, “there are many leaders of countries we can organize for you to have one on ones.” Bannon replied: “Agree 100% How do I do that???” When physicist Lawrence Krauss faced sexual harassment allegations, he emailed Epstein for advice on how to handle a journalist’s inquiry. After asking whether Krauss had had sex with the person in question, Epstein advised him not to reply to the journalist. Larry Summers , who was treasury secretary under Bill Clinton and later president of Harvard University, discussed his interactions with a woman and Epstein offered coaching on his response, writing: “you reacted well.. annoyed shows caring. , no whining showed strentgh.” In another email, Summers opined: “I’m trying to figure why American elite think if u murder your baby by beating and abandonment it must be irrelevant to your admission to Harvard, but hit on a few women 10 years ago and can’t work at a network or think tank. DO NOT REPEAT THIS INSIGHT.” In a further message, Summers asked: “How is life among the lucrative and louche?” Epstein replied: “When we meet I will endeavor to mesmerize you with stories of D.C. so wild !!!” Summers was not the only Democrat in Epstein’s orbit. Kathryn Ruemmler , a former White House counsel under Barack Obama, sent a message to him calling Trump “so gross”. A portion of that message was redacted, but Epstein replied: “worse in real life and upclose.” In other emails with Ruemmler, Epstein detailed a whirlwind of well-known people he appears to have been meeting, hosting or speaking with that week, including an ambassador, a tech giant, foreign business people, academics and a film director. “you are a welcome guest at any,” he wrote. In one message, Ruemmler expressed apparent contempt for the people of New Jersey as she planned a road trip to New York: “Think I am going to drive. I will then stop to pee and get gas at a rest stop on the New Jersey turnpike, will observe all of the people there who are at least 100 pounds overweight, will have a mild panic attack as a result of the observation, and will then decide that I am not eating another bite of food for the rest of my life out of fear that I will end up like one of these people.” The documents also cast significant doubt on the former prince Andrew’s official account of his relationship with Epstein and his accusers. An email from March 2011 shows continued contact four months after Andrew later publicly claimed to have ended the relationship. In a message to Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell regarding allegations, Andrew wrote: “I can’t take any more of this my end.” Another email appears to corroborate the famous photograph of Andrew with accuser Virginia Giuffre. Epstein wrote: “Yes, she was on my plane and yes, she had her photo taken with Andrew, as many of my employees have.” This stands in contrast with the prince’s public speculation during a 2019 interview that the photograph may have been faked. Journalist Michael Wolff appears in numerous exchanges, often acting as an informal adviser to Epstein regarding his relationship with Trump. In 2015, Wolff advised Epstein to “let him [Trump] hang himself” if Trump were asked about their relationship during a CNN appearance, suggesting that any denial from Trump would give Epstein “valuable PR and political currency”. Shortly before the 2016 election, Wolff wrote to Epstein: “There’s an opportunity to come forward this week and talk about Trump in such a way that could garner you great sympathy and help finish him. Interested?” The emails show that Epstein’s role in his network went far beyond social pleasantries. He was treated as a trusted consigliere, a fixer whose judgment on matters of politics, scandal and personal life was actively sought by the powerful. He even sought to shape foreign policy. In the run-up to Trump’s 2018 bilateral meeting with Vladimir Putin, Epstein proposed that Sergei Lavrov , Russia’s foreign minister, might benefit from his own insights into the then-US president. “I think you might suggest to Putin that Lavrov can get insight on talking to me,” Epstein wrote in an email to Thorbjørn Jagland, the former Norwegian prime minister who was at the helm of the Council of Europe at the time. Epstein went on to claim that he had previously discussed Trump with Vitaly Churkin, Russia’s ambassador to the UN, before Churkin’s death in 2017. “Churkin was great,” Epstein wrote. “He understood Trump after our conversations. It is not complex. He must be seen to get something – it’s that simple.” In January 2010, biotech venture capitalist Boris Nikolic was attending the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and Epstein emailed to ask: “any fun?” Nikolic replied that he had met “your friend” Bill Clinton , as well as then-French president Nicolas Sarkozy and “your other friend”, Andrew, “as he has some questions re microsoft”. But then Nikolic said he was getting sick of meetings. Later, he wrote Epstein that “it would be blast that you are here”. He mentioned flirting with a 22-year-old woman and wrote that “It turns out she is with her husand. Did not have chance to check him out. But as we concluded, anything good is rented ;)”. In emails with Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, an Emirati businessman, Epstein complimented Bannon, saying in 2018 that “We have become friends you will like him”. “Trump doesn’t like him,” responded Sulayem. A year earlier, Sulayem had asked Epstein about an event where it appeared Trump would be in attendance, asking: “Do you think it will be possible to shake hand with trump.” “Call to discuss,” Epstein wrote back. The list of associates was wide and varied. In 2011, Epstein asked the publicist Peggy Siegal to contact media entrepreneur Arianna Huffington to “champion the dangers of false allegations” and investigate accuser Virginia Giuffre. Siegal called the request “moronic”. In a 2015 email, Epstein offered Noam Chomsky , a linguist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and political activist, use of his New York and New Mexico residences. Their exchange also covered topics such as currency collapses and behavioral science. The artist Andres Serrano discussed the 2016 election with him, writing that he was so “disgusted by the outrage over ‘grab them by the pussy’ that I may give him my sympathy vote”. Epstein was also in touch with Peter Thiel , a Silicon Valley investor and ally of JD Vance. Epstein sent Thiel an email in 2014 saying “that was fun , see you in 3 weeks”. Four years later, Epstein asked if Thiel was enjoying Los Angeles, and, after Thiel said he could not complain, replied “Dec visit me Caribbean”. It is unclear whether Thiel ever responded. The secrets of Epstein’s inbox do not reveal an overarching conspiracy but paints a more sobering picture: a world where immense wealth, privileged access and proximity to power can insulate individuals from accountability and consequences. For those inside the circle, the rules of the outside world do not apply. Jamie Raskin , the top Democrat on the House judiciary committee, said: “This is a guy who I believe gave huge donations to colleges and universities, including Harvard and MIT, and those kinds of gifts can buy you a lot of currency and access in different elite circles. “People will want to know to what extent all of these different actors understood what was going on. It may be that the people he interacted with at MIT or Harvard did not have the same level of awareness as Prince Andrew or Donald Trump did but everybody should be asked to tell what they knew.” Jeffrey Epstein US politics Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor Peter Thiel Donald Trump Steve Bannon Larry Summers analysis",1971,732
17,Celebrity crib sheet: Sydney Sweeney is everywhere – here are nine things you need to know about her,Elle Hunt,2025-11-16T08:00:26.000Z,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/nov/16/celebrity-crib-sheet-sydney-sweeney-is-everywhere-here-are-nine-things-you-need-to-know-about-her,"A jeans ad made her notorious. Then she got cosy with Taylor Swift’s arch-nemesis. Time to get up to speed before the actor/model next hits the headlines … S pare a thought for Sydney Sweeney! Yes, she is young, beautiful, rich and talented, but she has also been getting it from all sides this week. Her passion project has bombed at the box office; she is still paying for a jeans she did four months ago, and being called on to address charges of having joked about eugenics; and fellow members of the Hollywood elite are breaking ranks to express their disdain (in one case, with a vomiting emoji). And, as she found out this week, she can’t even enjoy a kiss with her controversial new boyfriend without being snapped by the callous paparazzi! Here’s what you need to know when Sweeney’s name next crops up – which, if current trends continue, will be soon. 1. She’s dating Taylor Swift’s arch-nemesis Since September, Sweeney has been romantically linked with Scooter Braun, the music mogul best known for allegedly holding Taylor Swift’s song catalogue hostage. The pairing has generated discussion online for its apparent randomness and 16-year age gap, but they haven’t shied away from attention, either, being photographed together on several long and outdoors-y dates. The happy couple were recently papped sharing an intimate yet also highly visible moment, kissing on a rock in Central Park – suggesting they are at least not averse to publicity. Sweeney may be comfortable writing herself off the guest list for Swift’s wedding, but her affiliation with Swift’s arch-villain hasn’t helped with her increasingly embattled public image. 2. Bezos wants her for Bond Braun is not the only pop-culture “bad guy” Sweeney is cosy with. The couple reportedly connected at Jeff Bezos’s Venice wedding to Lauren Sánchez in June. Sweeney’s attendance at the lavish event initially raised eyebrows, given her lack of public connection to the Amazon founder, but was later explained as a money move, with Sweeney attached to a forthcoming blockbuster from Amazon MGM Studios. A source told Page Six that Sweeney “is not friends with either” Bezos or Sánchez, but “came to pay respects to the ‘boss’, just like in the old days of Hollywood”. Sweeney is also reported to be launching a lingerie line, backed by the private equity firm Coatue – where Scooter Braun’s friend Ben Schwerin, formerly of Snapchat, is a general partner – and $1bn in investment from Bezos and his bride. Bezos is now allegedly pushing for Sweeney to be made the next Bond girl. 3. She’s been dealt a KO blow at the box office Sweeney’s starring role in Christy, David Michôd’s biopic about the trailblazing boxer Christy Martin, has been widely interpreted as a bid to cement her as a serious actor, proving her chops with a physical transformation and gruelling training regimen. The film has received mixed reviews and, last week, bombed at the US box office, opening to just $1.3m. Sweeney, who made her name as an actor on the HBO teen drama Euphoria, has taken the blow in her stride, declaring on Instagram that she remained proud of the picture. “Why? Because we don’t always just make art for numbers, we make it for impact. And Christy has been the most impactful project of my life.” 4. She ‘did a jean ad’ Sweeney’s art, however, is increasingly at risk of being overshadowed by her controversies. In July, an ad for the denim company American Eagle, showing Sweeney decked out in denim with the tagline “Sydney Sweeney has great jeans” sparked instant controversy, seen by some as catering to the “male gaze” and subtly promoting whiteness . Since then, when asked about the ad on red carpets , Sweeney has barely been able to conceal her exasperation. Last week, she finally addressed the controversy – sort of. “I did a jean ad,” she, witheringly, told GQ. “I mean, the reaction definitely was a surprise, but I love jeans. All I wear are jeans. I’m literally in jeans and a T-shirt every day of my life.” Offered the chance to respond to criticism that “white people shouldn’t joke about genetic superiority”, Sweeney demurred: “I think that when I have an issue that I want to speak about, people will hear.” Her flippant, eye-rolling – not to mention, much belated – response to the controversy hasn’t won her fans. 5. She’s been adopted by the right Of course, it’s not just about the “jean ad”. In August, Sweeney was shown to have registered as a Republican voter, not long after recent family photos were published showing guests wearing Maga-style caps. Sweeney also registered in tax-friendly Florida, shortly after purchasing a $13.5m mansion. At the time, she dismissed the reporting of the images as “an absurd political statement” and asked the public to “stop making assumptions”. She has not commented on her politics, but the publicly accessible documents have for many been proof enough. Regardless of Sweeney’s relationship to the Republican party, they have been eager to align with her. Texas senator Ted Cruz declared criticism of the jean ad evidence that “the crazy left has come out against beautiful women”. And President Trump was also quick to lend his endorsement (“the ‘HOTTEST’ ad out there … Go get ‘em, Sydney!”). 6. She’s not the most popular woman in Hollywood This week, White Lotus star Aimee Lou Wood , musician SZA and actor Christina Ricci reportedly liked an Instagram video criticising Sweeney’s dismissive response to the American Eagle saga. (Wood also posted a vomiting emoji elsewhere.) Orange Is the New Black actor Ruby Rose (who lost out on the Christy role) also laid into Sweeney on Instagram Threads, writing : “You’re a cretin and you ruined the film. Period. Christy deserved better.” Rose’s objection was to an apparent Republican playing a gay woman: “None of ‘the people’ want to see someone who hates them, parading around pretending to be us.” 7. She’s also regular fodder for the discourse machine Between her sex-symbol status and her place in the culture wars, Sweeney is a recurring trending topic on X, variously lusted over and reviled. Last December, candid photos of the actor sparked what X generously described as “debates over beauty standards” that waged for several days. (Think Andrew Tate acolytes calling Sweeney “mid” and a “catfish”.) This week, a screenshot of her implacable response to the GQ interviewer has been taken up by right-wingers as a meme-ish expression of ideological superiority. The unseemly discourse is not just limited to online. After Sweeney played a Hooters waitress on SNL last year, the Spectator declared : “Yay! Boobs are back!” While, last month, conservative commentator Megyn Kelly railed against Sweeney’s sheer red-carpet gown: “I object.” In 2021, Sweeney tearfully addressed social-media trolling; more recently she has tried to rise above it, laughing off photographers’ demands to “show us those boobs” at the 2022 Met Gala. “It’s this weird relationship that people have with me that I have no control or say over,” she told Variety last year . 8. She’s not above selling out … Sweeney has established herself as a businesswoman, producing many of her recent films. She’s not been shy about chasing brand deals, promoting flip phones , face creams , ice-cream and “super soft slippers” . “If I just acted, I wouldn’t be able to afford my life in LA … They don’t pay actors like they used to,” Sweeney explained in 2022 . Earlier this year, Sweeney partnered with a “men’s personal company” to produce a limited edition soap, marketed as containing a “touch” of her own bath water. “Why? Because y’all wouldn’t stop asking,” said the company , Dr Squatch, giving the soap’s scent as “morning wood”. 9. … but now she could do with a win Sweeney has re-cast box-office misfires as stepping stones to success. As her co-stars strained to apologise for their part in 2024’s disastrous Madame Web , Sweeney explained it as one of her “strategic business decisions”, enabling her “to build a relationship with Sony” that later led to Anyone But You. The charming 2023 romcom was a surprise hit, buoyed up by Sweeney’s on-screen chemistry (and rumoured romance) with her co-star Glen Powell. That same year, Sweeney delivered a powerful performance in Reality, playing an NSA whistleblower word-for-word from the interrogation transcript. But this year all four of Sweeney’s tentpole projects – Ron Howard’s historical thriller Eden, the cowboy crime-drama Americana, the straight-to-streaming Echo Valley , and now Oscar bait Christy – have fallen flat at the box office. Sweeney’s still standing, but if she is to get off the ropes, she’ll need a win soon. Sydney Sweeney Celebrity crib sheet Celebrity features",1800,731
18,Questions arise over strikingly similar signatures by Trump on recent pardons,Edward Helmore,2025-11-15T15:21:53.000Z,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/15/trump-signatures-clemency-orders,"Seemingly identical signatures appeared on clemency orders, which White House blamed on technical error The Trump administration’s clemency drive is coming under scrutiny after the justice department this week replaced pardons posted online that bore strikingly similar copies of Trump’s signature with others that are distinctively variable. The corrections came after online commenters seized on the similarities in the president’s signature granting “full and unconditional” pardons to seven men, including to former New York Mets player Darryl Strawberry , former Tennessee House speaker Glen Casada and former New York police sergeant Michael McMahon, on 7 November. Administration officials have blamed “technical” errors and staffing issues for the apparent oversight and insisted to the Associated Press that Trump had originally signed all the pardons himself. Chad Gilmartin, a justice department spokesperson, said the “website was updated after a technical error where one of the signatures President Trump personally signed was mistakenly uploaded multiple times due to staffing issues caused by the Democrat shutdown”. “There is no story here other than the fact that President Trump signed seven pardons by hand and [the Department of Justice] posted those same seven pardons with seven unique signatures to our website,” Gilmartin said in a statement to the Associated Press, referring to the latest wave of clemency Trump has granted in recent weeks. White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson wrote in an email that Trump “signed each one of these pardons by hand as he does with all pardons”. “The media should spend their time investigating Joe Biden’s countless autopenned pardons, not covering a non-story,” she wrote. The errors come after a sustained administration campaign to undermine the validity of pardons issued by Trump’s predecessor Joe Biden that were in many cases signed by autopen. Trump has claimed that Biden was not aware of the signatures on orders and pardons bearing his name. Trump, who typically makes an elaborate show of signing executive orders with a Sharpie at afternoon press calls, has gone so far as to replace Biden’s portrait in a new “Presidential Walk of Fame” he created along the West Wing colonnade with a picture of an autopen. Asked last week whether he had considered replacing that image with a portrait, Trump responded: “No, I don’t think so.” Questions about Trump’s signature come amid a new flurry of clemency orders . Last month, Trump issued a pardon to Changpeng Zhao, later telling CBS News that he had “no idea who he is” but had been told the crypto-currency businessman was a victim of a “witch-hunt” by the Biden administration. Zhao, who is also known as “CZ”, pleaded guilty to enabling money laundering in 2023. He served four months in prison and agreed to step down as the chief executive of Binance, the crypto exchange he co-founded. “A basic axiom of handwriting identification science is that no two signatures are going to bear the exact same design features in every aspect,” Thomas Vastrick, a Florida-based handwriting expert and president of the American Society of Questioned Document Examiners, told the AP. “It’s very straightforward,” Vastrick added. Legal experts say the use of an autopen has no bearing on the validity of the pardons. “The key to pardon validity is whether the president intended to grant the pardon,” said Frank Bowman, a legal historian and professor emeritus at the University of Missouri School of Law who is writing a book on pardons. “Any re-signing is an obvious, and rather silly, effort to avoid comparison to Biden.” The pardons issued by Trump earlier this month include Casada, a disgraced former Republican speaker of the Tennessee house who was sentenced in September to three years in prison after being convicted of working with a former legislative aide to win taxpayer-funded mail business from state lawmakers who previously drove Casada from office amid a sexting scandal. Sign up to This Week in Trumpland A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration after newsletter promotion Strawberry was convicted in the 1990s of tax evasion and drug charges. McMahon was sentenced to 18 months in prison earlier this year for his role in what a federal judge called “a campaign of transnational repression”. On Friday, Trump issued a pardon to Dan Wilson, a militia member who joined the Capitol riot on 6 January 2021, on a conviction for felony gun possession, Politico reported. Wilson, who has identified himself as a member of the Oath Keepers and Gray Ghost Partisan Rangers militia, had already been given clemency for his involvement in the riot. The justice department’s replacement of Trump’s signature on the pardon documents is unlikely to stall Republicans’ autopen trolling of Biden. Last month, Republicans in Congress released a sharp critique of Biden’s alleged “diminished faculties” and mental state during his term that ranked the Democrat’s use of the autopen among “the greatest scandals in US history”. The Republicans said their findings cast doubt on all of Biden’s actions in office and sent a letter to the US attorney general, Pam Bondi, urging a full investigation. “Senior White House officials did not know who operated the autopen and its use was not sufficiently controlled or documented to prevent abuse,” the House oversight committee found. “The committee deems void all executive actions signed by the autopen without proper, corresponding, contemporaneous, written approval traceable to the president’s own consent.” On Friday, Republicans who control the committee released a statement that characterized Trump’s potential use of an electronic signature as legitimate, which it distinguished from Biden’s. Dave Min, a California Democrat on the House oversight committee, seized on the apparent similarities in the initial version of the pardons and called for an investigation of the matter, deploying the Republican arguments against Biden in a statement to AP that “we need to better understand who is actually in charge of the White House, because Trump seems to be slipping”.

19,Marjorie Taylor Greene says Trump’s remarks hurtful but hopes they can make up,Joanna Walters,2025-11-16T15:48:41.000Z,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/16/marjorie-taylor-greene-trump-remarks,"Congresswoman, a longtime Trump ally, pushes back on president’s remarks labeling her a traitor and a lunatic Georgia congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene on Sunday called Donald Trump’s remarks labeling her a traitor and a lunatic “hurtful” but said she hopes she and the US president can “make up”, despite stark differences over policy and the release of documents about Jeffrey Epstein . Greene, a longtime ally and fierce defender of Trump and the Make America Great Again (Maga) base, pushed back against his name-calling, in her first interview since Trump withdrew his support for her on Friday. She told CNN’s State of the Union show: “His remarks, of course, have been hurtful … the most hurtful thing he said, which is absolutely untrue, is he called me a traitor and that is so extremely wrong.” Greene said on Saturday she had been contacted by private security firms “with warnings for my safety” since Trump said he was withdrawing his endorsement of her as a Republican member of Congress, following several days of remarks and posts criticizing her. Greene had said in an X post that “a hot bed of threats against me are being fueled and egged on by the most powerful man in the world”, without referring to Trump by name, adding it was “the man I supported and helped get elected”. She did not go into further detail on Sunday morning about the nature and sources of such threats. But she added in her TV interview about Trump’s attacks, especially the label traitor, that: “Those are the types of words used that can radicalize people against me and put my life in danger.” “It has all come down to the ‘Epstein files’ and that is shocking and, you know, I stand with these women, I stand with rape victims … and survivors of trafficking … I believe the country deserves transparency in these files,” she said. Greene plans to join a vote in the House of Representatives later this week to demand the release of all files held by the US government on Epstein, the late financier and sex offender who killed himself in prison while awaiting trial on sex offenses in New York in 2019. Even though the Senate is expected to kill any such bill, the upcoming vote and last week’s release of thousands of documents with revelations about Epstein’s ties to Trump, Steve Bannon and other powerful figures , is putting huge pressure on the administration, including from victims of Epstein. Greene’s falling out with Trump was months in the making but matters escalated dramatically in recent weeks. Greene also called on Sunday for an end to “toxic infighting” in politics. CNN anchor Dana Bash challenged Greene on her track record of past violent rhetoric towards Democrats, including Nancy Pelosi , Barack Obama and posts such as an image of herself posing with a gun alongside pictures of the “Squad” group of congressional left-wingers, including Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez . “I’m sorry for taking part in the toxic politics … put down the knives, be kind to one another … I never wanted to cause any harm,” Greene said. Greene has also diverged from Trump’s focus on foreign policy issues, arguing he should be concentrating on bringing down inflation in the US and take an even harder line on immigration. “I would like to see Air Force One parked and staying at home,” she said. But she ended the interview with CNN, when asked if there could be reconciliation with Trump, by saying: “Well, I certainly hope that we can make up. I can only speak for myself, I’m a Christian and one of the most important parts of our faith is forgiveness, and that’s something I’m committed to.” Donald Trump Marjorie Taylor Greene Jeffrey Epstein Trump administration US politics news",738,332
20,Merchants’ ‘victory’ over credit card fees will just complicate things more for them,Gene Marks,2025-11-16T15:00:34.000Z,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/nov/16/small-business-credit-card-fees,"Do small business owners think that Visa and Mastercard won’t just recoup their fees elsewhere? W ant to buy a new shirt from your friendly neighborhood small business? In some cases, be prepared to pay out 2.5% more as a “financing” fee because you’re using a credit card. Enjoying that meal at the local diner? Better have cash or you could be subject to the same fee. Grabbing a bag of chips and a soda at the local convenience store? Oops … Unless you’re prepared to spend a minimum of 10 bucks you can’t use your credit card, sorry. I’ve always been irritated by these practices. And I know I’m not alone. Who carries cash any more? Why are we, the customer, being shamed because we choose to buy something using what has become a standard form of payment over something that’s clearly a thing of the past? Merchants have been fighting the credit card companies about these fees for years. And now they’ve won. This past week, Visa and Mastercard ended their battle , and now future fees will probably be lower for consumers that use some cards, particularly the ones that offer fewer rewards. But did these businesses really win? I’m not so sure. Be careful what you ask for. Because thanks to this “victory”, these businesses are complicating things even more for the consumer and themselves. Fees will probably be layered based on the card used and some business owners may even find themselves rejecting some cards altogether because the fees are too high. The average consumer carries about four credit cards, according to some studies . Up until now all were treated equally. But no longer. Can I use this card to buy a packet of chips or that card? Will merchants now provide a list of cards that are acceptable to them? Will I be penalized otherwise or turned away at the door? By making things more difficult for your customer, you’re risking the sale. Or a future sale if the headaches of doing business with you outweigh the benefits. And you’re increasing your costs to account for the different cards used and fees charged and for what you’ll probably pay your point of sale system provider to help you do this. Small business owners complain about the high merchant fees charged by credit card companies, and yet it’s those very same small businesses who heavily rely on these services. According to the National Bureau of Economic Research , credit card payments (and usage) by small businesses increased from $10,000 a month on average in 2020 to $24,000 a month by April 2022. About 55% of small businesses surveyed said they used a corporate credit card in the past 12 months. The settlement will probably have a rewards boomerang effect on these very same businesses. Credit card companies use merchant fees to establish partnerships with thousands of businesses so that their customers can enjoy more products, services and travel perks by using their cards. Some cards offer as much as 1% to 5% back at office supply stores and on internet, cable and phone services, as well as at gas stations, restaurants and other locations. Others have partnerships with brands such as Google Workspace, ZipRecruiter and Lyft that offer ongoing credits and price reductions on their services specifically to small businesses. Talk about biting the hand that feeds you. These services and programs will probably be rolled back, or made more expensive. And it’s the small business owner who will be penalized. Limiting awards also means limiting revenue. Many studies have shown that consumers tend to spend more at a business when using their credit card. Credit card rewards programs also include countless small merchants offering their wares. By participating in these programs, these small business owners enjoyed introductions to new customers that never would have known about them otherwise. Finally, who are we kidding? Do we really think Mastercard and Visa aren’t going to make up for these costs elsewhere? Of course they will. They’ll charge higher annual membership fees to the business owners who enjoy these perks and increase late payment and penalty fees or special charges for things like fraud investigations which are paid by – you guessed it – business people. They’ll raise interest rates on foreign transaction and cash advance fees that are also paid by businesses, or pass down higher costs to their partners like banks and other financial service providers, who will in turn pass these costs to their customers who are – ready? – business people. If you run a retail shop or a diner, isn’t it easier to just calculate how much the merchant fee costs as a percentage of your total revenues and then spread out a small price increase among all your products, where the impact would be barely noticed? Will a customer care if they’re paying $12.50 or $12.75 for a burger? No. Will they raise an eyebrow because you’re charging an additional fee on top of the entire bill because – gasp – they don’t use cash? Yes, they will. Small businesses are deluding themselves when they say this credit card settlement is a victory. All this does is create more costs, not less.

22,EU investigates Google over ‘demotion’ of commercial content from news media,Lisa O’Carroll,2025-11-13T13:16:23.000Z,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/nov/13/eu-investigates-google-search-over-demoting-commercial-content-from-news-media,"Some content created with advertisers is no longer visible, which could mean loss of revenue, officials say The EU has opened an investigation into Google Search over concerns the US tech company has been “demoting” commercial content from news media sites. The bloc’s executive arm announced the move after monitoring found that certain content created with advertisers and sponsors was being given such a low priority by Google that it was in effect no longer visible in search results. European Commission officials said this potentially unfair “loss of visibility and of revenue” to media owners could be a result of an anti-spam policy Google operates. Under the rules of the Digital Market Act (DMA), which governs competition in the tech sectors, Google must apply “fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory conditions of access to publishers’ websites on Google Search”. Commission officials said the investigation was not into the overall indexing of newspapers or their reporting on Google Search, just into commercial content provided by third parties. Media partnerships with businesses selling goods or services ranging from holidays to trainers were “normal commercial practice in the offline world” and they should also exist in a fair online marketplace such as Google, officials said. For example a newspaper may have teamed up with Nike to offer discounts, but there was evidence that under a Google search, that sub-domain of the newspaper would be “demoted to a point that users will not be able to find it any more”. That in turn affects the newspaper. “We are concerned that Google’s policies do not allow news publishers to be treated in a fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory manner in its search results,” said Teresa Ribera, the executive vice-president for clean, just and competitive transition policies at the European Commission. Officials will ask publishers to submit evidence of any impacts to its traffic and revenues as a result of suspected breaches of fair practices in the coming days, the commission said. Ribera added: “We will investigate to ensure that news publishers are not losing out on important revenues at a difficult time for the industry, and to ensure Google complies with the Digital Markets Act. “Today we are taking action to ensure that digital gatekeepers do not unfairly restrict businesses that rely on them from promoting their own products and services.” Google hit out at the EU’s investigation, calling it “misguided” and “without merit”. Sign up to Business Today Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning after newsletter promotion It said in a blogpost: “Unfortunately, the investigation announced today into our anti-spam efforts is misguided and risks harming millions of European users. “And the investigation is without merit: a German court has already dismissed a similar claim, ruling that our anti-spam policy was valid, reasonable, and applied consistently.” It said the policy was designed to build “trustworthy results” and “fight deceptive pay-for-play tactics” that “degrade” Google Search listings. The EU said it was compelled to take steps to protect traditional media, which were now competing in the marketplace online, given the recent assertion by the commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, in her state of the union address that the media at large were at risk with the arrival of AI and widespread threats to media funding. Officials stressed the investigation was a “normal non-compliance” inquiry and although fines of up to 20% of revenue could be imposed, that would only be a possibility if Google was found to be practising “systematic non-compliance”.

24,Anthropic announces $50bn plan for datacenter construction in US,,2025-11-12T22:29:49.000Z,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/nov/12/anthropic-50bn-datacenter-construction,"AI startup behind Claude chatbot working with London-based Fluidstack on building vast new computing facilities Artificial intelligence company Anthropic announced a $50bn investment in computing infrastructure on Wednesday that will include new datacenters in Texas and New York . “We’re getting closer to AI that can accelerate scientific discovery and help solve complex problems in ways that weren’t possible before,” Anthropic’s CEO, Dario Amodei, said in a press release. Building the massive information warehouses takes an average of two years in the US and requires copious amounts of energy to fuel the facilities. The company, maker of the AI chatbot Claude, popular with businesses adopting AI, said in a statement that the “scale of this investment is necessary to meet the growing demand for Claude from hundreds of thousands of businesses while keeping our research at the frontier”. Anthropic said its projects will create about 800 permanent jobs and 2,400 construction jobs. The startup said it is working with London-based Fluidstack to build the new computing facilities to power its AI systems. It didn’t disclose their exact locations or what source of electricity the facilities will need. The latest deals show that the tech industry is moving forward on huge spending to build energy-hungry AI infrastructure, despite lingering financial concerns about a bubble, environmental considerations and the political effects of fast-rising electricity bills in the communities where they’re constructed. Another company, cryptocurrency-mining datacenter developer TeraWulf, has previously revealed it was working with Fluidstack on Google-backed datacenter projects in Texas and New York , on the shore of Lake Ontario. Microsoft also on Wednesday announced a new datacenter under construction in Atlanta, Georgia, describing it as connected to another in Wisconsin to form a “massive supercomputer” running on hundreds of thousands of Nvidia chips to power AI technology. A report last month from TD Cowen said that the leading cloud computing providers leased a “staggering” amount of US datacenter capacity in the third fiscal quarter of this year, amounting to more than 7.4GW of energy, more than all of last year combined. The tech industry’s huge amount of spending on computing infrastructure for AI startups that aren’t yet profitable has fueled concerns about an AI investment bubble.

25,Waymo announces that its robotaxis will drive freeways for the first time,,2025-11-12T21:57:56.000Z,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/nov/12/waymo-robotaxis-freeways,"Google subsidiary to offer services on San Francisco, LA and Phoenix freeways as it scales expansion amid competition Alphabet’s Waymo said on Wednesday that it would begin offering robotaxi rides that use freeways across San Francisco, Los Angeles and Phoenix, a first for the Google subsidiary as it steps up expansion amid global and domestic competition in the self-driving industry. Freeway rides will initially be available to early-access users, Waymo said. “When a freeway route is meaningfully faster, they can be matched with a freeway trip, providing quicker, smoother, and more efficient rides,” it said. Waymo, which already operates in parts of the San Francisco Bay Area, is also extending operations to San Jose, including Mineta San Jose international airport, the second airport in its service area after Phoenix Sky Harbor. The move comes as Tesla expands its robotaxi service with safety monitors and drivers, and Zoox – backed by Amazon – offers free robotaxi rides on and around the Las Vegas Strip. Waymo is the only company that runs a paid robotaxi service in the US, a fleet of more than 1,500 vehicles, without safety drivers or in-vehicle monitors. Waymo first began offering paid rides in Phoenix, Arizona in 2020 about 11 years after the company, formerly known just as Google’s self-driving car project, first began working on developing and testing out autonomous technology. Waymo has been growing slowly but steadily over the years, and the company, like its rivals, has faced federal investigations over unexpected driving behavior. Freeway driving is relatively less complicated than navigating the many variables of a city street but introduces a new set of factors the vehicles have to maneuver around at much faster speeds, including other merging vehicles and how to exit. While operating autonomous vehicles is more challenging in a city with pedestrians, frequent intersections and unpredictable situations, any mistakes or malfunctions at high speeds on a freeway could have severe consequences. The company said it had developed new freeway protocols with local highway patrols and safety agencies.
